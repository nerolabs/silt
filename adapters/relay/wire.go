// Package relay is the universal NAT fallback (#27, cross-network
// design 2c): when two peers are both behind home routers, neither can
// accept the other's inbound connection — but both can make outbound
// ones, so they meet at a third node that is reachable.
//
// The shape (libp2p Circuit Relay v2's, without the dependency):
//
//	NATed B ──standing control conn──► Relay R ◄──per-message dial── S
//
//	1. B registers: one outbound TLS conn to R, kept alive with pings.
//	   B advertises "relay:R@host:port" as its address.
//	2. S wants B: dials R, sends connect{B}. R tells B over the control
//	   conn: incoming{stream}. R parks S's conn.
//	3. B dials a SECOND outbound conn to R: accept{stream}. R splices
//	   the two conns into one raw pipe and tells both ends "ok".
//	4. S runs its normal end-to-end TLS handshake with B THROUGH the
//	   pipe. This is the crucial part: Silt's security model says a
//	   frame's sender is whoever the TLS handshake authenticated, and
//	   that must hold across a relay. It does, because the relay only
//	   ever carries S↔B TLS bytes it cannot read, alter, or forge —
//	   content-blind by construction, not by promise.
//
// The relay learns which two NodeIDs talked, when, and how much —
// metadata, the same the threat model already concedes to any on-path
// router. It never sees plaintext, and Silt payloads are ciphertext
// under yet another layer anyway.
//
// Relaying is a node capability (-relay), not special infrastructure:
// any daemon that is publicly reachable can offer it, capped so it
// can't be trivially drained. Nothing in the protocol privileges any
// particular relay, and no relay address is baked into the binary.
