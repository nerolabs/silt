// Package client holds fetcher-side helpers that compose the node with real transport

// D3 issuance-mixing (#179) — slice 1, the ephemeral-identity withdrawal. The token
// issuer authenticates whoever dials it via the end-to-end TLS handshake, so a demand
// withdrawal made over a fetcher's durable identity LINKS that withdrawal to the
// fetcher — the blind signature hides only the token serial, not the network identity.
// This severs that link: the withdrawal is made over a FRESH EPHEMERAL identity (a
// throwaway keypair) and paid with a PREPAID BLIND CREDIT rather than a durable account,
// so the issuer authenticates only an unlinkable ephemeral key and charges no account it
// can tie to the fetcher. Relay-routing (the IP link, slice 2) and epoch-batching
// (timing, deferred to the H8 mixnet) are the further D3 hardening.

// WithdrawDemandTokenPrivately performs a D3 private demand-token withdrawal from the
// issuer at issuerAddr, paying with a prepaid blind credit. It spins up a one-off
// ephemeral identity + transport, withdraws over it, and tears everything down on
// return. It returns the withdrawn token and the ephemeral NodeID the issuer saw (never
// the fetcher's durable one). credit is a blind credit acquired earlier under the
// durable identity (Node.AcquireCredits).
//
// THE CALLER RESOLVES (issuerPub, epoch) AGAINST ITS CHAIN — it does not accept
// whatever key the issuer serves (R0.4b, red-team break 5). The ephemeral node has no
// chain, so it cannot check a key against the committed E ↦ key_E binding itself; the
// DURABLE parent does that with Node.ResolvedDemandIssuerKey and passes the pair down.
// That is what keeps a per-cohort key a DENIAL rather than an accepted, tagged token:
// the epoch is inside the blind-signed message, so an issuer signing under any other
// key produces a reply this withdrawal refuses (ErrDemandEpochMismatch) instead of a
// token whose "which key verified you" fingerprints the cohort. Passing an unresolved
// key here re-opens that channel — there is no safe way to call this with a key the
// caller did not resolve.
//
// issuerAddr severs one or two links depending on its form (D3):
//   - a DIRECT "host:port" hides the fetcher's IDENTITY (the issuer authenticates only
//     the ephemeral key) but the issuer still sees the fetcher's IP (slice 1);
//   - a RELAY-form "relay:R@host:port" (the issuer's advertised relay address) ALSO
//     hides the fetcher's IP: the ephemeral transport dials the issuer THROUGH the relay,
//     so the issuer's inbound connection is from the relay, not the fetcher (slice 2).
//     The end-to-end TLS still authenticates the ephemeral key across the relay pipe.
//
// Timing-correlation (epoch-batching) is the remaining D3 hardening, deferred to the H8
// mixnet.
