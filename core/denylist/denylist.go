// Package denylist is Silt's takedown mechanism. It answers a hard
// question honestly: on an append-only chain, a published identifier can
// never be un-recorded — so how does illegal content get removed?
//
// The answer is that removal happens at the AVAILABILITY layer, not the
// ledger layer. The chain keeps its immutable record of "root X was
// published" (an opaque 32-byte hash — a fingerprint, not content), but
// compliant nodes NO-OP on a denied root: they refuse to store, serve,
// announce, or repair its chunks, and a chain-backed registry refuses to
// resolve it. The file's chunks stop being hosted and repaired, so its
// redundancy decays and it rots off the network — even though its name
// persists in history. Deletion of the RECORD is neither possible nor
// necessary; what matters is that the CONTENT becomes unreachable.
//
// Crucially this never touches encryption. A denied root is matched by
// its hash; nothing is decrypted, and infrastructure stays content-blind.
//
// A Set is populated two ways: from on-chain revocation records
// (append-only tombstones committed by the same reputation quorum that
// commits publications, so takedown replicates and is tamper-evident like
// everything else), and from an operator's local file (a jurisdiction's
// list, a trusted blocklist). It is deliberately not a single global
// authority — operators choose which lists to honor, the way DNS and mail
// operators choose blocklists.
