// Package bond is the identity-bound storage commitment that puts a
// PRICE ON IDENTITY. To hold consensus standing (core/credit Reputation),
// a node must maintain a large, per-identity blob it can be challenged on
// at any moment. Two Sybils are two DISTINCT multi-GB blobs that each
// occupy real disk, so N identities cost N×size of real storage — the
// missing Sybil cost the reputation-quorum chain has always assumed but
// never charged (threat-catalog B1/D3).
//
// PROOF OF SPACE — the plot is a VERIFIED graph-labeling proof-of-space (M0
// Sybil design turn G2, docs/design/m0-sybil-rebind.md). The plot is sealed
// from a PUBLIC, identity- and size-bound seed
//
//	seed = H("silt/bond/plot/v3" ‖ pk ‖ n)          // pk = validator ed25519 key, n = NumBlocks(size)
//
// folded into BOTH the block labels (plotBlock) and the DRSample parent draws
// (parentIndices). Because the seed folds in n, a PREFIX of an n-block plot is
// NOT a valid m-block plot — the byte-identical-prefix Sybil (G2) is dead at the
// data layer. Because the seed folds in pk, a plot sealed for one identity
// produces labels that fail recomputation under any other identity's key.
//
// The seed is public precisely so the VERIFIER can recompute a label without
// holding the plot: the space-time answer opens k challenged interior nodes,
// each with its predecessor and its DRSample parents (Merkle-proven), and the
// verifier recomputes plotBlock(seed, v, parents) from the opened parent BYTES
// and requires it to equal the opened node (verifyLabels). This turns "valid
// block" into a RECOMPUTABLE PUBLIC PREDICATE, so reused or arbitrary bytes are
// rejectable — the depth-robust labeling now buys real soundness, not just
// honest-prover cost. Identity and size are CHECKED properties of the plot, not
// claimed ones, so N standings require N plots (invariant B1 restored). k is a
// per-network knob (Answer/Verify take it; 0 resolves to DefaultLabelSamples),
// with soundness error ≤ (1-ε)^k against an ε-short prover (design §3).
//
// SPACE-HARDNESS — each block i is a memory-hard label over a proven depth-robust
// graph (DRSample, Alwen–Blocki–Harsha CCS'17): it mixes the seed, the index, and
// the FULL BYTES of its immediate predecessor and its DRSample parents (not their
// 32-byte leaves). Recomputing block i on demand requires the parents' bytes,
// recursively, and depth-robustness makes that pebbling cost Ω(n) — so the
// rational strategy is to STORE the S bytes; the charged size equals the resident
// footprint. Merkle possession sampling (Samples) still catches a prover MISSING
// blocks; the labeling opens (k) catch a prover holding arbitrary/short/reused
// bytes — the two are complementary (design §3.1), not substitutes.
//
// SPACE-TIME — the VDF is bound to a plot READ before it runs (fixes F2). The
// per-epoch challenge first samples one plot block (seedIndex), and the VDF is
// seeded from that block's bytes (challengeSeedST): a prover that has released
// the space cannot produce the seed without first re-deriving the block, which
// is the Ω(n) memory-hard recompute above. Tuned so re-plot ≫ one epoch, this
// makes release-and-replay uneconomical — the sequential VDF work then binds
// FRESH elapsed time on top of proven possession. The VDF output also picks the
// k labeling nodes, so a released prover cannot know which to keep resident until
// the sequential work is done. Verification stays O((Samples + 5k)·log n): no
// fetch, no VDF re-run.
//
// HONESTLY LABELED — what this does and does not prove:
//   - It delivers VERIFIED SPACE-hardness over a proven depth-robust graph and
//     binds the TIME half to possession; the tight ε→k constant through indegree-4
//     DRSample, and the re-plot-≫-epoch floor, are the external red-team's target
//     (design §8, immutable B8: self-marked homework is not adversarial proof).
//   - No replication proof and no zero-knowledge: it proves "this identity holds a
//     distinct blob of this size," not "this is a unique replica of user data."
//     Elevating held REAL network content to standing (so the Sybil cost and
//     durability funding become one mechanism) is the intended follow-up; the
//     synthetic bond here is the cold-start.
