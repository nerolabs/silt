// Package chain is the registry as an append-only block chain,
// maintained by the daemons themselves — the M12 replacement for the
// "single honest instance". The consensus is deliberately NOT
// proof-of-work: blocks commit by reputation-weighted quorum.
//
//   - A block is proposed by a node whose reputation clears
//     MinProposerRep, and commits only with attestations (Ed25519
//     signatures over the block hash) from at least Quorum DISTINCT
//     validators, each clearing MinAttesterRep, none of them the
//     proposer. No single node's say-so writes a block.
//   - Reputation is earned the M7/M9 way: passed storage audits and
//     bytes served (see credit.Reputation). A fresh identity starts at
//     zero and cannot propose or attest; and because NodeID is the hash
//     of the signing key (M10), reputation cannot be transplanted.
//   - Blocks carry registry entries only — root, manifest chunk
//     pointers, size. Manifests stay chunked and sealed off-chain, so
//     the chain stays small and content-blind.
//
// Every validator holds a full replica and validates everything: a
// block is accepted exactly when its hashes, signatures, reputations,
// quorum, and entries all check out against the local replica. Honest
// scope note: this is a quorum chain for a network with an honest
// validator majority, not a fork-choice consensus for adversarial
// partitions — there is no chain reorganization in v1; first valid
// block at a height wins.
