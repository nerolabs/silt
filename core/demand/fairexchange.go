// Optimistic fair exchange (D-DEMAND P2) — the ASW-shaped floor silt can build in
// pure Go. The exchange is content C (server → fetcher) ⟷ a delivery receipt
// (fetcher → server, the server's demand credit). Fair exchange PROVABLY needs a TTP
// (Pagnia–Gärtner); silt's is the VALIDATOR QUORUM as a threshold-distributed TTP
// (Asokan–Shoup–Waidner), meant to be invoked ONLY on dispute.
//
// WHAT M0 BUILDS (this file + the abort-safety regressions): the optimistic path and
// its two abort-SAFETY properties, which hold structurally today.
//
//  1. FETCHER-SIDE abort safety: an aborted exchange never CONSUMES the fetcher's
//     token. A serial is spent only by a completed Bank.Redeem (a valid PoR-bound
//     receipt), so a server that takes the commitment and then vanishes — or delivers
//     nothing — leaves the paid token UNSPENT and reusable at another server. The
//     fetcher cannot be robbed of its token by a non-delivering server.
//
//  2. SERVER-SIDE abort safety: a fetcher's pre-release ExchangeCommitment — a signed
//     promise made BEFORE content release, carrying NO proof of possession — is NOT a
//     redeemable receipt. It is domain-separated from the DeliveryReceipt signature
//     so a server cannot convert "the fetcher engaged" into a fake
//     completed delivery. The unforgeability bound (#receipts(C) ≤ #completed
//     paid deliveries) survives the abort path: only Ack's receipt-domain
//     signature redeems.
//
// WHAT IS GATED (the dispute-RESOLUTION half, deliberately not built): converting a
// server-held commitment into a TTP-affidavit receipt on a fetcher default requires
// the quorum-TTP to VERIFY that delivery genuinely completed WITHOUT the fetcher's
// cooperation — i.e. VERIFIABLE ESCROW of the content key (Camenisch–Shoup: encrypt K
// under the TTP's key + a ZK proof the ciphertext opens C) with THRESHOLD DECRYPTION
// t-of-n across the validators (so no single one is the center). The threshold-
// decryption / DKG half is available in Go (dedis/kyber, drand-grade); the missing
// piece is the verifiable-escrow primitive — no adoptable, audited pure-Go
// implementation — and standing up the whole stack is a large NEW cryptographic trust
// surface. That is disproportionate for M0, where the protected quantity is a NEUTRAL,
// never-standing observable: an unresolved server-side abort only UNDERCOUNTS demand
// (never moves standing), so the missing affidavit path costs no security today. Same
// STRATEGY as H7's blind proof-of-repair (ship a floor, document the heavy crypto as a
// fast-follow), different primitive (H7 was a char-2 field-algebra wall; this is a
// missing verifiable-escrow lib). Held in tension; ExchangeCommitment is the exact seam
// the future resolver consumes.

// commitDomain separates a pre-release exchange promise from a delivery receipt: a
// commitment signature can never be lifted onto a DeliveryReceipt (different domain,
// different message), so it cannot masquerade as proof of a completed delivery.
const commitDomain = "silt/demand/exchange-commit/v1"

// ExchangeCommitment is a fetcher's pre-release, non-repudiable promise to complete an
// exchange for (serial, object, server): the ASW artifact a server would present to
// the quorum-TTP on a fetcher default. It deliberately carries NO possession proof, so
// it is evidence of ENGAGEMENT, never of DELIVERY — the bank never credits demand from
// it; only a receipt-domain-signed DeliveryReceipt (Ack → Redeem) does.

	Sig     []byte       // fetcher signature over commitmentMsg
}

// this exchange so a defaulting fetcher leaves the server non-repudiable evidence.
