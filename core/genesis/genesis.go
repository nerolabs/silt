// Package genesis is the network's first block — the founding manifesto
// that every fresh chain is born carrying, the way Bitcoin's genesis
// block hardcodes the Times headline. It is never downloaded or agreed:
// it is EMBEDDED in the binary and declared identically by every node,
// so all replicas share it by construction. Real blocks (earned by
// audit-backed quorum) build on top of it at height 1.
//
// The genesis file is also seeded into each node's store, so the
// manifesto is the one file the whole network always carries and anyone
// can retrieve by its (well-known, deterministic) link.
//
// Determinism is the whole trick: convergent encryption + fixed
// chunking/erasure means running Build on the embedded manifesto yields
// byte-identical chunks, the same root, the same link, and — signed by
// a fixed genesis key — the same block hash, on every machine. Swap the
// manifesto text and everything downstream regenerates; nothing here is
// a magic constant.

// fork). TestGenesisBlockHashIsPinned holds the current hash as a literal,
// so from here it moves only by an explicit, recorded decision. Whether
