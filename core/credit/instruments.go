// The finite-but-renewable durability instruments (H7 slice 3, decision D-S7).
//
// silt does NOT promise perpetual cold-data solvency — that promise is the Arweave
// endowment identity in credits, and it holds only if the credit-denominated cost
// of storage keeps falling. 2020s hardware evidence (HDD $/TB plateauing) says it
// may not. So silt ships durability as an explicit finite-but-renewable contract:
// fund a horizon, let the serve auto-skim extend it, and re-endow before it runs
// out. These pure functions are how an operator or the observatory MEASURES where
// an object sits on that contract, from a ports.DurabilitySnapshot:
//
// - CostPerRepair — the realised credits per shard-repair so far.
// - Horizon — how long the current reserve lasts at the observed burn.
// - G — instrument g: the annualized trend of cost-per-repair, the
// single number that decides perpetual-vs-finite. g stays
// MEASURED, never assumed: "perpetual" is a claim silt earns
// only while g > 0, never an architectural promise.
//
// They read only observable accounting — never Reputation — so measuring durability
// can't perturb standing.

// elapsed observation window. It returns (remaining, finite):

// `remaining` at the observed burn (re-endow before then).
// - finite == false → no burn has been observed (Paid == 0) or the window is
// non-positive, so the reserve is unbounded at the current (zero) rate. This
// is NOT "perpetual achieved": it means the horizon is not yet measurable, and
