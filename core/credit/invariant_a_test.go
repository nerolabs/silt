// M0 hardening H3 — the Invariant-A structural guardrail.
//
// Invariant A (docs/design/m0-hardening-strategy.md §2): no standing without a
// verified, identity-bound, unpredictable-challenge, deduped, bond-gated proof.
//
// The strategy doc's meta-pattern #1 is "we fix instances, not classes": F1 →
// G2 → RT-1 were three re-instances of one class (a standing press that skips
// identity-binding), and we only ever hardened the surface a red team pointed
// at. This file is the guardrail that turns the class into a compile-and-test
// obligation: it ENUMERATES every press that can mint standing and asserts each
// satisfies Invariant A, and it fails loudly when a new Ledger method ships
// unclassified — so a fourth instance cannot slip in unaudited.
//
// Why enumerating *credit.Ledger is complete for the MINT side: all standing
// state lives in credit.account (bondedBytes/auditsFailed/bondFails/
// equivocations), Reputation is a pure function of those fields, and
// credit.Ledger is the sole ports.CreditLedger implementation (sim wraps it).
// So every way to move standing is a method on *Ledger — enumerate them and the
// mint surface is closed. The consumption side (who READS Reputation to gate
// consensus) is surface S4, guarded elsewhere.

// standingClass is how a Ledger method may move consensus standing (Reputation).
