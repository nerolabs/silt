// Durability escrow — the H7/S7 funding layer (issue #95, docs/decisions.md
// D-S7). The repair loop that keeps content alive under churn must be paid in
// equilibrium, not charity — the wound that killed Freenet/GNUnet. This file is
// the accounting for that: a per-object credit reserve that pays repair
// bounties, kept solvent by an auto-skim of the object's own serving revenue,
// with a rarest-shard multiplier that pays most to repair the stripe closest to
// data loss.
//
// THE ONE LOAD-BEARING INVARIANT. Escrow lives in the BALANCE economy: it moves
// the credit unit between node balances and object reserves, and that is ALL it
// does. No field here ever feeds Reputation (core/credit.go). The durability
// budget confers ZERO consensus standing. If it did, the shared-content sealing
// hole (γ→1/N) would re-open: one physical copy of an erasure-coded shard could
// answer for N pledges and buy N nodes' standing. Standing is minted by the bond
// press alone (RecordBondChallenge). Every method in this file is classified
// `neutral` by the Invariant-A guard (invariant_a_test.go), and that guard fails
// the build if a new escrow method ships unclassified — so the firewall cannot
// silently erode.
//
// Prototype-first (this is H7 slice 1): these are the ledger primitives. Wiring
// the auto-skim into the live serve path (node.go) and gating PayBounty on a
// verified proof-of-repair transcript are later slices; here PayBounty trusts
// its caller, and RecordServeToObject is the object-aware serve the wiring will
// call.

// shardBytes are Evolving-tier — an absolute base would silently mis-price a repair
// the moment those re-tune. `k × shardBytes` is the coherent FLOOR: it covers the
// dominant repair cost (fetch k survivor shards to reconstruct one), while ongoing
// custody is funded by the serve economy, not this one-time bounty.
//
// c = 1 is RESEARCH-CERTIFIED (2026-08-19): decode is <0.1% of the fetch cost so
// nothing pushes it above 1; it is g-neutral (a constant scale factor cancels in
// the cost-trend); and it is the smallest floor-honest value, so it least shortens
// the funded horizon. Solvency is a (c, skim) PAIR — `base × m̄ × R ≤ V × skim` ⇒
// self-funding above ~24 retrievals/repair at c=1, m̄≈3 — which holds for HOT data;
// cold data stays prepay-dependent (D-S7 finite horizon), the mechanism's honest
