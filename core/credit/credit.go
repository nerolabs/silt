// Package credit is the v1 ledger. It runs TWO economies that earlier
// versions conflated — and the conflation was the wash-serving hole:
//
//   - BALANCES (RecordServe → 1 byte served = 1 credit, minus a publish
//     fee). Still self-reported and DELIBERATELY GAMEABLE: two colluding
//     nodes can ping-pong a chunk to mint credit and nothing here
//     notices. That is fine — balances fund the anti-spam publish fee and
//     drive the observatory's who-earns/who-freeloads metrics. They are
//     NOT a security boundary and never gate consensus.
//
//   - STANDING (Reputation → the number the chain gates writes on). This
//     is NO LONGER self-reported. It is built only on evidence a Sybil
//     cannot fabricate: challenged, identity-bound held storage
//     (RecordBondChallenge, backed by core/bond) and passed storage
//     audits (core/node/por.go). Wash-serving moves balances but buys
//     ZERO standing — which is what closes the reputation→quorum-capture
//     path (threat-catalog D1/D3): standing now costs real disk, not
//     chatter. See Reputation and RecordBondChallenge.
