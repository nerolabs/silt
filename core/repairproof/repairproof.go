// Package repairproof is the correctness leg of H7 proof-of-correct-repair
// (docs/design/h7-proof-of-repair.md): given a caretaker's CLAIM that it repaired
// a lost shard, decide whether the produced shard really is the correct Reed–
// Solomon codeword coordinate for its stripe — so a repair bounty pays only for a
// real, correct repair, never a bare claim.
//
// M0 uses the RECOMPUTE construction: reconstruct the target position from k
// survivor shards and check the result is byte-identical to what the manifest
// already commits to (its content-addressed shard ID). This is:
//
//   - SOUND — Reed–Solomon reconstruction is deterministic, so the claim is
//     accepted iff the produced bytes ARE the codeword coordinate the survivors
//     imply, and the survivors are pinned by their manifest-anchored IDs. There is
//     no other ground truth in a content-addressed system: "correct" means
//     "consistent with the manifest-anchored survivors under the public code."
//   - PUBLICLY CHECKABLE — anyone holding the survivor bytes and the committed
//     target ID can rerun it and get the same answer, so a false claim's rejection
//     is a reproducible fraud proof (no trusted verifier, no secret key).
//   - CONTENT-BLIND — silt caretakers verify over ciphertext shards under the
//     layout key; no plaintext is ever seen.
//
// What it is NOT (an explicit M0 non-goal): it is not BANDWIDTH-blind — the
// verifier must hold k survivor shards to recompute. The succinct, fetch-free
// homomorphic-commitment upgrade is impossible in pure Go over silt's GF(2^8)
// storage without changing the storage code: there is no ring homomorphism
// GF(2^8) → F_r (characteristic 2 vs r), so a prime-field Pedersen/KZG commitment
// cannot carry the GF(2^8) XOR relation with a linear homomorphic check. The two
// blind upgrades — moving the correctness code to F_p (Semi-AVID-PR) or adopting a
// characteristic-2-native binding commitment (FRI-Binius) — are fast-follows, not
// M0 (see the design doc §3-§4, §7).
//
// This package is pure: it speaks in shard bytes and IDs, touches no store, no
// network, no ledger. Wiring it into the repair loop, binding it to a Shacham–
// Waters retrievability proof under the repairer's identity, gating the bounty
// release on a caretaker quorum, and slashing an attributable false claim are the
// later steps of the slice (design doc §5-§8).

//
//   - p is the stripe's (k, n) code.
//   - survivors maps a stripe position (0..n-1, data 0..k-1 then parity k..n-1) to
//     that shard's bytes, none at `target`; the bytes are trusted only as far as the
//     caller has verified them against their own committed IDs (a survivor whose
//     bytes don't match its ID is not a survivor — verify before calling). It must
//     hold enough entries that the supplied survivors PLUS the implicit-zero padding
//     slots [realData, k) total at least k. On a FULL stripe (realData == k) there is
//     no padding, so that is the familiar "at least k supplied survivors". On a short
//     final stripe the padding counts for free, exactly as it does in
//     erasure.ReconstructStripe.
//   - realData is how many leading data positions of the stripe are real chunks
//     (the rest are implicit zero padding of a short final stripe); it must be
//     1..k, exactly as core/erasure uses it.
//   - want is the manifest-committed content ID of the target shard.
//
// It returns true iff the recomputed target hashes to `want`. A wrong-but-claimed
// shard, a garbage claim, or a survivor set that reconstructs to something else all
// return false. It errors only on structurally invalid input (bad params, target
// out of range, a survivor at the target, too few survivors) — an error is a
// malformed challenge, distinct from a well-formed claim that fails to verify.

	// ReconstructStripe's, minus the target: uniform slack N-K-1 for every realData.

	// The zeros are JUDGE-DERIVED, not claimant-supplied: realData comes from the
	// caller's own manifest layout and the claimant determines nothing about them. The
