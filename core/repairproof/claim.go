package repairproof

// RepairClaim is the wire announcement a caretaker broadcasts after it
// reconstructs a lost shard and places the rebuilt copy on a fresh storage node
// (the paramedic split — design doc §8b). It names WHAT was repaired and WHO now
// holds it, so the object's other caretakers can independently verify and settle
// the bounty. It deliberately does NOT carry the survivor set or the code
// parameters: a verifying caretaker takes those from the manifest it already holds
// and picks its own k survivors to recompute — so a claimant cannot bias the
// correctness check by dictating which survivors to use.
//
// The claim is not trusted on its face: correctness is re-derived (VerifyByRecompute
// against the manifest-committed ShardID) and retrievability is re-challenged
// against Holder under an identity-bound seed. The claim only points the verifiers
// at the work; the proofs are recomputed.
//
// ADVERSARY-SHAPE: capability=ClaimantChosenSurvivorSet UNCOVERED: no fixture GRANTS AND CONTROLS FOR a claimant any influence over which survivors the judge fetches. TestRTRC1_SurvivorFetchIsUnboundedPerSenderAndIsNMinusOneWide_PINNED_DEFECT shows the influence is REAL and negative -- an out-of-range claim.ShardPos excludes nothing and costs all n instead of n-1 -- but it carries no control that removes the influence, so it is not declared as cover.
