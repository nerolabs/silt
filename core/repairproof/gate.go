// RepairChallengeSeed binds a proof-of-retrievability challenge to the repairer's
// OWN node identity: seed = H("silt/repair/challenge/prover/v1" ‖ base ‖ repairer).
// This closes the double-count / relay attack (design §5): a claimant cannot answer
// a bounty challenge by relaying an existing honest holder's proof of an
// already-present replica, because that proof was aggregated under the holder's
// seed and fails under the claimant's. It mirrors core/node porProverSeed for the
// bond-audit path — the same defense H1/RT-1 gave the standing bond, inherited here
// for the durability bounty.
//
// ADVERSARY-SHAPE: capability=RelayedHolderProof UNCOVERED: no capability-holding fixture exists anywhere in the tree granting a claimant an honest holder's proof of an already-present replica. The seed binding does deny a REPLAY; the outsourcing variant -- asking the holder to compute under the CLAIMANT's seed -- is pinned open on the audit path by TestRT_POR_2_ChallengeProxyPassesAudit_PINNED_DEFECT and is untested here.

// VerifyRetrievability checks that `repairer` actually holds the rebuilt shard NOW,

// the file's layout key (por.DeriveKey); unitID is the shard's ID (domain-separates
// the tags); base is the challenge nonce for this round; blocks is the shard's
// block count and count the number sampled. It returns true iff the prover
// demonstrably holds every sampled block — a data-less claimant, or one relaying a
// proof built under another identity's seed, cannot make it verify.
//
// ADVERSARY-SHAPE: capability=DataLessClaimant UNCOVERED: no capability-holding fixture exists anywhere in the tree granting a claimant a passing retrievability answer without the bytes. This leg is also not the one that fails a NO-LOSS claim: the named holder genuinely holds, and TestRTRC3_ClaimWithNoLossIsPaid_PINNED_DEFECT pins that gap. ROADMAP row F1.

//
//   - CORRECTNESS is deterministic and publicly reproducible (VerifyByRecompute), so

//     carries its own fraud proof. correctnessOK=false ⇒ Slash, no release — full
//     stop, regardless of retrievability.
//   - RETRIEVABILITY is where independent verifiers add value (each issues its own
//     identity-bound random challenge), so release additionally requires a τ-of-q
//     quorum of caretakers to confirm it.
//
// A retrievability shortfall (fewer than τ confirmations) DENIES the bounty but does
// NOT slash: it may be transient (the repairer is briefly offline or slow), and only
// the unambiguous, mathematically-attributable correctness lie is ever punished.
// τ must be ≥ 1; a non-positive τ is treated as "no valid quorum" and denies.
