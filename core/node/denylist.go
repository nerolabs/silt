// Takedown enforcement on a node. A node no-ops on a denied root: it
// won't accept its chunks, serve them, prove them, announce them, or
// repair the file. See docs/safety-denylist.md.
//
// Governance note baked into the shape of this code: there is NO
// built-in list and NO privileged authority. A node's denials come only
// from (a) the on-chain revocation records its own replica has committed
// by reputation quorum, and (b) a local list its OPERATOR chose to load.
// The software ships the mechanism; it never ships a list and never
// phones home. Whoever runs the network runs the policy — the project
// that publishes this code does not.
