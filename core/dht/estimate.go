// EstimateNetworkSize infers how many nodes exist in the whole network
// from nothing but the distances to your m nearest known neighbors —
// counting a crowd you cannot see. See.
//
// The idea: node IDs are uniform in a space of 2^256 points. If the
// m-th closest node to you sits at XOR distance d, then a ball of
// radius d around you contains m nodes, so the network's density is
// ≈ m/d nodes per unit of ID space, and the whole space holds
//
//	N ≈ m · 2^256 / d
//
// It only works if peers really are your m nearest — which is exactly
// what a Kademlia node's own neighborhood (self-lookup, close buckets)
// gives it. Accuracy is within a small constant factor, which is all
// capacity planning needs.
