// maxStripeCoResidency is the harness's omniscient anti-affinity view:
// the largest number of distinct shards of any single stripe that one
// ALIVE node holds. 1 is perfect spread — no node is doubled up on a
// stripe, so one death costs that stripe at most one shard. >1 means a
// stripe has clustered onto fewer hosts, eroding the erasure budget.
// skip excludes caretakers: a caretaker fetches a whole stripe into its
// own store to reconstruct and only purges it in cleanup, so sampling
// mid-sweep would count that transient holding as clustering. The
// durability invariant is about where shards come to rest on storage
// nodes, so we measure those.
