## Part 0 — Why silt exists (the mission-immutable)

**M0 — silt exists to *hold* the privacy × accountability × Sybil trilemma —
to refuse to trade any corner away.** Three properties every prior system in
this space has been forced to trade off against each other, held together
without sacrificing one for the other two:

- **Privacy** — publishing is *unlinkable* to a durable identity; and silt
  *refuses to surveil* who fetches what, pursuing access-privacy to the
  metadata-layer limit the anonymity trilemma allows (not an absolute blob-layer
  guarantee).
- **Accountability** — genuinely harmful content can be removed, curators are
  themselves accountable, and takedown is **pluralistic** — never a global
  switch.
- **Sybil-resistance** — standing cannot be cheaply forged; no actor can spin up
  identities to capture consensus, wash reputation, or flood a denylist.

The incumbents each pick two corners and surrender the third. **silt's reason to
exist is to hold all three** — and **abandoning any corner is abandoning the
project.**

**This is "hold," not "resolve."** It is not a claim to have *solved* a research
problem all at once; it is the refusal to trade a corner away, and a design in
which the corners *co-mature* rather than arriving finished. Precisely:

- **Privacy is architectural from day one** — private-by-default encryption,
  opaque ciphertext, a refuse-to-surveil access posture, blind-signed publish
  tokens. It does not wait for the network to grow.
- **Accountability is content-level and reactive from day one** — takedown acts
  on a *hash*, pluralistically and after the fact; it is never identity-level,
  never pre-emptive, never a global switch.
- **Sybil-resistance is the corner that bootstraps.** It is the *weakest on a
  young network* — a small network is cheapest to flood — and it *strengthens as
  real, sustained work accrues*. During the launch window, anchor validators are
  explicit, time-boxed training wheels that shed on measured decentralization via a
  **one-way latch** (`everMature`) that, once tripped, never re-arms — so a later
  drop in decentralization cannot hand the launch anchors permanent power (immutable
  #3: *no permanent center*, F-1). De-maturation liveness is then a real-bond ≥⅔
  super-quorum, and a fresh node is pinned to a recent **weak-subjectivity checkpoint**
  for cold sync (silt is weakly subjective, like every proof-of-stake-class system).
  This is the live edge where the novel contribution concentrates.

**M0 is falsifiable, not a slogan.** It is *held* if and only if the adversarial
red-team suite (V3), written by a party *other than the author* (see B8),
**denies all three failure modes**: publish→identity linkage (privacy),
identity-level or global takedown (accountability), and **Sybil-farm standing
*at a discount* (Sybil-resistance)** — where the Sybil mode is the *systemic*
claim, not any single primitive: **C1 — no discount:** no strategy earns a
fraction *q* of consensus standing for less than ≈ *q* × the real resource an
honest provider pays for that much *served, sustained, address-diverse* storage;
**C2 — no quiet capture:** the objective concentration metric keeps the minimum
colluding *operator* set that reaches quorum capture above a target *k*, sampled
Byzantine-robustly. A single bond or proof failing a standalone
"is-it-Sybil-proof?" test is **not** an M0 failure if the *composed* system
satisfies C1 + C2 (see B8). "Did we hold M0?" therefore has a yes/no answer, on
the board, that an outsider can check — not a victory declared by the builder.

Everything below is either a corner made structural, or the discipline that
keeps the composition honest.

**The bet, stated without a slogan.** Two of the three edges are dissolved by
architecture silt already has: privacy-vs-accountability dissolves because we
act on **content, not identity** (deny a *hash*; hosts are content-blind and
carry no liability for what they cannot read). The live edge — where the novel
contribution concentrates — is **privacy vs. Sybil**: we **decouple the cost of
*creating* an identity from the cost of *having standing***. Identity is free
and pseudonymous; *influence* costs sustained, challenged, real work; and the
publishing act stays cryptographically **unlinkable** from that bonded identity.
The load-bearing, field-defining claim is therefore:

> **Token-less, work-backed, identity-bound reputation that publishing stays
> cryptographically unlinkable from** — cheap for one honest node, ruinous for a
> Sybil farm, with no coin and no capital lockup.

**Where the ruin comes from — composition, not a lone primitive.** No single
mechanism can *prevent* Sybils under free minting + no permanent center
(Douceur); the guarantee lives in the *system*. Each part denies one economy of
scale a Sybil relies on — one plot backing many identities (size-bound bond),
synthetic bytes standing in for real storage (unique-sealed real content),
self-dealt demand (witnessed, *unlinkable* demand receipts that reuse the
blind-token primitive), free keys massed near a target (address/AS-diversity
buckets), coasting on stale standing (retention decay/TTL forces continuous
re-proof — note T is *retention only*: there is no acquisition-time accrual,
so acquisition is priced by D alone). Composed so
every shortcut on one axis trips another axis's check, the *target composition*
makes **forging N standings cost N× of *every* non-substitutable resource** —
which is honest provision. **⚠️ Shipped subset vs. target (be honest which):**
today consensus *standing* is gated by the **bond (disk) axis alone**; the
served-demand axis (B) is an unbuilt track (D-DEMAND / #181),
address-diversity (A) lives in the DHT layer (H5), not yet in the standing
number, and **T (time) ships for retention only** (decay/TTL) with **no
acquisition-time accrual** (a time-acquisition ramp is deferred — a bare age
gate is pre-farmable). So `C_honest ≈ D` in force today, `D×A×T×B` as the target — the interlock
is designed, not fully wired, and the C1 claim is *conditional* (see
`design/m0.md` §3, §7, §10). Sybil-resistance is therefore *re-pricing +
concentration-bounding*, not
prevention; the residual — an honest whale who genuinely provides that much — is
*bounded* by C2's shed metric, not eliminated.

This is not a labeled placeholder for V1 (see Part IX): it *is* the mission, so
it is the one mechanism deliberately pulled into V1 scope, and it must ship
**specified and adversarially proven**, not asserted.

---

## Part I — What silt is

**T0 — Two planes, one substrate.** silt is *BitTorrent + BitCoin*: a
**storage plane** (content-addressed, erasure-coded, peer-served chunks with
NAT-traversal) and a **trust plane** (consensus-secured registry, reputation,
and revocation). The storage plane stands alone and is the default; the trust
plane is opt-in and secures governance. Neither is the product — silt is the
**substrate** other things are built on, and the trust plane is where M0 lives.

**T1 — Capabilities, not infrastructure.** Every role (store, relay, registry,
validate, caretake) is a *capability any node can offer*, never a special node
baked into the binary. No node is *permanently* load-bearing; none is
irreplaceable. A young network may lean on explicit, time-boxed scaffolding
(launch-window anchors), but that scaffolding is designed to shed on measured
decentralization — the forbidden thing is a *standing* dependency on any one
node, not the honest scaffolding that retires itself (immutable #3).

**T2 — The link is the primitive.** A `silt:` link is the whole product surface
for a user: content-addressed identity + the key to read it. Durability,
placement, and repair are the network's job, not the holder's.

**T3 — The naming boundary is immutable (Aslan).** Core resolves *hashes*,
never *names*. Turning an opaque root into human meaning (names, descriptions,
moderation, curation) is a separate resolver layer ("Aslan"), and Silt core
**carries zero meaning, forever**. This is a liability firewall as much as an
architecture: the moment core learned to resolve names it would inherit every
takedown, copyright, and safety obligation it exists to shed. Any change that
teaches core about meaning is a top-severity regression. A link guarantees the
*bytes it names*; trusting a *name* is trusting whatever resolver you asked —
like trusting a DNS provider. "File poisoning" (a name resolving to hostile
content) is therefore a resolver-layer concern by design.

**silt is use-agnostic.** Core carries zero meaning, and silt takes zero
position on *use*. We do not enumerate, endorse, or concern ourselves with what
flows through it — file-sharing, archival, a library of record, or anything
else users choose is unenumerated and not silt's business. silt's only ambition
is to be the most trusted, private, secure, scalable, and efficient DFS ever
built, chosen for its feature set. **"Aslan" names any client or application
built *on top of* silt** — the application layer, expected to be richly diverse,
is where use lives; silt below it neither knows nor cares. We expect Aslan use
cases to drive interest and grow the network, and we care about none of them
beyond ordinary DFS use.

---

## Part II — How we build

**B1 — Hexagonal core.** Domain logic is pure and portable; all I/O (disk,
network, clock) lives in adapters at the edge. The seam is where a real
implementation swaps in for a simulated one with zero core changes.

**B2 — Lock-free, single-loop core.** Node logic runs on one serialized loop:
no locks, no goroutines in the core. This is what makes the simulator
deterministic and the real network inherit the same guarantee.

**B3 — Content-addressed, and never trusted blindly.** Identity is the hash of
the bytes. Every read re-verifies against its hash — *disks lie, networks lie*.
Convergent encryption makes identical content converge to identical identity
(dedup), and the publisher's identity is metadata, not part of what content
*is*.

**B4 — Privacy by construction.** Hosts store opaque ciphertext they cannot
read and did not choose by content. This is both a user promise (privacy) and
an operator promise (no liability for the unknowable).

**B5 — Legibility.** Code reads like the code around it; a behavior narrates
itself (the `-log info` path exists so the field can see the normal path, not
just failures). We optimize for the next reader.

**B6 — Reactive, not eager.** Data moves when it must (repair on loss, fan-out
on heat), not on a schedule. Idle is cheap; the system quiesces.

**B7 — Trust but verify; no optimistic operations.** B3 generalized from reads
to *every* operation: an operation is not "done" until its effect is
**confirmed**, never assumed. A write is durable only when read back or
acknowledged by ≥k independent parties; a placement is complete only when
providers confirm they hold it; a publish returns a link only once the content
is provably retrievable. We take the **cynical** default — disks, networks,
peers, and *our own prior steps* lie until proven otherwise — so an optimistic
ack is a **defect, not an optimization** (learned the hard way — a publish once
returned a valid-looking link for content it never durably stored, #60). Where
verification genuinely conflicts with another tenet (e.g. latency/cost vs. S6,
or eagerness vs. B6), the exception is made **explicit and discussed**, never
taken silently.

**B8 — Best components, novel composition.** We never reinvent a primitive —
cryptography, transport, codec, hash. We adopt the single strongest *proven*
one and treat rolling our own as the amateur tell it is. Novelty is reserved
for the **composition and incentive design**, where the hard problems (M0)
actually live — and that novelty must be **specified and adversarially proven**
(a spec a skeptic can read and a red-team suite they can't break), never
hand-waved. **The adversary must be external.** Self-marked homework is not
adversarial proof: the attacks that certify a novel composition must be written
by a party *other than its author* — an independent audit, a public bounty, or a
separate red-team — because single-author crypto graded by its own author is the
exact failure mode this tenet exists to forbid. **The suite tests the
composition, not the parts.** Because the novelty *is* the composition, the
certifying attacks target the system-level claim (M0's C1 + C2), not each
primitive in isolation — a primitive that fails a standalone "Sybil-proof" test
is *expected* (that is Douceur, not a defect) and counts as an M0 failure only
if the *composed* system admits a discount (¬C1) or a quiet capture (¬C2).
Boring parts; a novel car.
Novel-and-unproven is worse than me-too — it ships insecurity to the exact
audience we need to convince.

---

## Part III — What a successful outcome is (the bar)

**S1 — Integrity is non-negotiable; availability is engineered.** Bytes are
either bit-perfect or an explicit failure — **never silently wrong**. (Our
scaling test: 0 corruption across every fetch — that is the floor, not an
achievement.) Availability, by contrast, is a probability we raise with
redundancy, placement, and repair.

**S2 — Content outlives any node.** Durability comes from erasure coding ×
cross-node replication × failure-domain spread × an ongoing repair loop that
outruns failure — not from any node being reliable.

**S3 — No silent-loss shapes.** Any operation that can't complete must fail
*visibly and recoverably*. A publish that half-succeeds and strands content
with no retrievable link is a bug of the highest severity (learned the hard way
— #46).

**S4 — No single point of failure or control.** If one machine dying — or one
operator deciding — can take content down globally, we have failed a core
promise.

**S5 — Honest observability.** An operator can see what is *true*: real peers
vs. ghosts, actual redundancy, caretaker coverage, cache effectiveness. We do
not ship dashboards that flatter (the network-size estimate counting dead
ephemeral identities was a lie we had to fix — #43).

**S6 — Cheap to participate.** The bar for running *any* role is low enough
that a hobbyist can. Cost that scales unbounded with network activity is a
design defect, not a fact of life. *(This is also the constraint that makes M0's
Sybil corner hard: cheap for the honest, ruinous for the liar — without a
capital lockup that would price out the hobbyist.)*

**S7 — Durability must pay for itself.** The repair loop that keeps content
alive under churn must be **funded in equilibrium, not run on charity.**
Reputation buys *presence*; it does not, by itself, buy *sustained repair
bandwidth* when nodes are leaving faster than they arrive. An economy where
storing and repairing is a net cost with no matching reward decays to zero the
moment altruism runs out — this is the wound that killed Freenet and GNUnet, one
genre earlier. So durability is not "solved" until the caretaker who repairs a
stripe they neither own nor can read is **paid by the demand that content
serves** (ties to caretakers #44 and the economics gates). **The *design goal* is
one ledger:** the served, sustained real content a node holds would be both what
earns its repair reward *and* what backs its consensus standing (M0) — durability
budget and Sybil budget read from two sides of the same disk. **⚠️ That fusion is
NOT shipped, and deliberately so.** Today consensus standing comes *only* from a
**dedicated, identity-keyed bond plot** (throwaway labels), **separate** from the
useful shared content a node serves; served content and PoR audits mint **no**
standing. Fusing served content *into* standing is blocked by the **γ→1/N
shared-content shortcut** — one physical copy of a shared erasure-coded shard
would answer for N pledges — which stays open until identity-keyed PoRep sealing
exists (the single core research problem, `design/m0.md` §10 / issue #182). The
C1 "no discount" claim is **gated on this separation holding**. So S7's
equilibrium and M0's Sybil corner are *designed* to be one mechanism, but are two
separate ledgers today; treating them as already-fused would re-open the exact
Sybil break the separation exists to prevent.

**The funding model (decided, per the durability research):** no *speculative
external* token — but silt's internal credit unit is made **durable, escrowable,
and forwardable in time**, and durability is funded by a **per-object durability
escrow** (a prepaid credit reserve) that **auto-skims** a fixed fraction of each
object's serving revenue back into that object's reserve, paying repair bounties
scaled by how under-replicated a stripe is (rarest-shard first). These credits
fund *durability* and confer *no* consensus standing — standing stays
work-backed and coin-free. **Center-less proof-of-correct-repair is BUILT**
(H7 / issue #95): a bounty pays the new holder of a rebuilt shard only when
**correctness** (reconstruct from the manifest-anchored survivors and check the
content address — a Merkle recompute) *and* an identity-bound **Shacham–Waters**
retrievability proof both verify, checked by a **care-link quorum** with no
coordinator, and an attributable false claim slashes the bond — a *composition of
proven primitives*, no new invention for the plain-RS case (see
[decisions.md](decisions.md) D-S7). *(The plaintext-blind commitment the design
preferred — a transparent binary-field PCS — is a GF(2⁸) dead end in pure Go, so
M0 ships the recompute floor and the bandwidth-blind upgrade is a fast-follow.)*
Note this proves a repair is *correct* — a
different axis from the γ→1/N sharing problem above; it does **not** make one
shared copy stop answering for N pledges.

**Durability is finite-but-renewable, not "perpetual."** The per-repair game is
solved, but *perpetual* cold-data solvency is the Arweave endowment identity in
credits — it holds only while `g > 0`, a strictly positive credit-denominated
cost-of-storage decline, which 2020s hardware evidence no longer guarantees. So
silt funds a horizon, auto-skims to extend it, and asks for re-endowment before
expiry — solvent for *any* sign of `g` — and publishes the funded horizon per
object. "Perpetual" is a claim silt *earns only if measured `g` stays positive*,
never an architectural promise; `g` is the one number to instrument.

If we
cannot state the equilibrium in which repair funds itself, we have not decided
durability —
and it is durability that decides whether files exist in three years, not
whether they exist today.

---

## Part IV — How we test

**V1 — Sim first, field second, both required.** Deterministic simulation
proves logic (including Byzantine and churn cases, reproducibly); a
multi-machine field test proves it against real NAT, real WAN, real timeouts.
A behavior is not "done" until it has cleared *both*.

**V2 — Conformance over trust.** Every implementation of a seam (e.g.
`ChunkStore`) passes one shared conformance suite, so "however many
implementations, one contract."

**V3 — Test the adversary.** We write the attacker's desired outcome as a test
that must fail for them: forgery, tamper, equivocation, freeload, Sybil,
censorship. Security is validated by denial, not assertion. For M0's novel
mechanisms this is the *primary* proof: the red-team suite is the deliverable,
and the M0 verdict is exactly its result (Part 0). The suite that *certifies*
M0 must be written by an **external** party (audit / bounty / independent
red-team, per B8) — we may write our own attacks to develop against, but the
proof that ships is the one an outsider could not break.

**V4 — Evidence, not vibes.** A change clears the success bar (Part III) with
observed evidence — a checksum match, a survived kill, a green Byzantine
suite — reported faithfully, including what was skipped.

**V5 — A bug fixed once stays fixed, and breaks are caught locally.** Every
defect we discover ships in the *same change* as a test that **fails before
the fix and passes after**, added at the tier(s) where the bug actually lives
(unit for pure logic; integration/sim for components-in-a-peer and multi-node;
e2e / the local NAT harness for real daemons over real sockets). A fix without
its regression test is not done. And the regression must be catchable by the
**local** suite — `go test ./...` plus the local integration harness
(`integration/nat`, which any contributor can run on one machine with Docker) —
so a re-break surfaces on the developer's machine in seconds, not at merge or in
CI. CI is the backstop that enforces this for everyone; it is never the *first*
place a regression is allowed to appear. This is how a growing codebase stays
fast to change: the bigger silt gets, the more we rely on knowing instantly
when we broke something we already fixed.

---

## Part V — How we release

**R1 — Gated by proof.** An RC requires the plane's core promises
*field-proven*: cross-network publish/fetch, scaling under load, crash
recovery, and — because the trust plane is a V1 pillar — the M0 mechanisms
proven **multi-machine**, not sim-or-single-host only. Sim-proven-only work is
labeled as such and is not an RC gate on its own.

**R2 — Canon tracks behavior.** Changelog discipline; docs and these tenets are
updated in the same change that alters behavior. No silent drift between what
the system does and what we say it does.

**R3 — Throwaway stays throwaway.** Test/dev infrastructure (a dev relay, a
demo registry) is never allowed to quietly become load-bearing.

**R4 — Operator-autonomous updates, security-gated.** Operators control their
own software; the network **never silently auto-updates**. Only security uses
graduated enforcement, and the maintainers set the tier: **criticality-graded**
(Low = advisory · Medium = 30 days · High = 7 days · Critical = 24–48h before
patched peers refuse old versions), via **threshold-signed** (m-of-n),
**recallable** (monotonic sequence), **observation-clocked** version-floor
advisories that fail *open*. Critical is a gate of last resort. Whoever can
declare Critical can halt the network, so no single key may — the signing
threshold *is* the safety property.

---

## Part VI — The don'ts (bright lines)

1. **Never force a registry or relay operator to also store or serve content.**
2. **Never enable silent or global censorship.** Takedown is transparent,
   consensual, and pluralistic — never a single kill switch.
3. **Never surveil access.** silt builds no mechanism to observe or link
   who-fetches-what, and pursues access-privacy to the anonymity trilemma's
   metadata-layer limit — a goal held in tension (bounded by that wall and by
   anonymity-set size), not an absolute blob-layer guarantee. The refusal to
   build surveillance is absolute.
4. **Never a silent-loss failure shape** (see S3).
5. **Never bake in a special or central node** (see T1).
6. **Never trust bytes without verifying** (see B3).
7. **Never let the economy reward useless or harmful work** — reward tracks
   value delivered to the layer above.
8. **Never build a decryption backdoor.** Core holds no capability to decrypt
   stored content, and silt ships no threshold- or quorum-decryption of it.
   Accountable disclosure, if it ever exists, is an Aslan-layer choice made by
   parties who can already read — never a core capability (reinforces immutable
   #1 content-blind, T3).

---

## Part VII — Per-persona tenets (outcomes → promise)

### A. Value personas

**1. Content consumers (clients — "Aslan users").**
- **Outcomes:** available when asked; authentic; private access; runs no
  infrastructure; a given link keeps working.
- **Promise:** a link is enough — retrieval, verification, and durability are
  the network's job, and silt never surveils what you fetch (access-privacy is
  pursued to the metadata-layer limit the trilemma allows).

**2. Publishers / creators.**
- **Outcomes:** content stays available as long as intended, and they can *tell
  whether it will*; access control + revocation; integrity + attribution;
  cheap publishing; publish without being deanonymized; no silent disappearance.
- **Promise:** you can make content durable and know its durability; you can
  revoke; no one alters it under your name; your publish is unlinkable to your
  standing (M0); taking it down is visible, never silent.

**3. Link recipients (audience).**
- **Outcomes:** the link resolves; bytes are the intended ones; private stays
  private.
- **Promise:** a valid link is a cryptographic guarantee of *what* you'll get.

### B. Infrastructure personas

**4. Storage-node operators.**
- **Outcomes:** fair, predictable reward for disk + bandwidth; legal safety
  (host unknowable ciphertext; refuse lists they choose); free to come and go;
  reputation that accrues and ports.
- **Promise:** contribute capacity, earn proportional standing/credit, carry no
  liability for what you cannot inspect, and never be punished for churn.

**5. Registry operators.**
- **Outcomes:** a public good that *doesn't cost them* (minimal disk/bandwidth);
  never forced to store/serve; not a single point of failure or liability.
- **Promise:** running rendezvous is cheap enough to be near-free; the registry
  is a cache/accelerator over the DHT, so losing one costs latency, not
  availability. *(This is the crux of #47/#48.)*

**6. Relay operators.**
- **Outcomes:** content-blind (no liability); bounded, capped cost; rewarded/
  reputed for reachability.
- **Promise:** you forward ciphertext you can't read, within a cap you set, and
  can't be turned into anyone's free CDN.

**7. Caretakers (durability providers).**
- **Outcomes:** rewarded for keeping content alive; can repair content they
  neither own nor can decrypt; clear signal of what needs care and whether
  they're succeeding.
- **Promise:** repair rights are delegable and auditable; durability is a
  *service* a publisher can buy and a caretaker can sell. *(The gap in #44.)*

### C. Trust & governance personas

**8. Validators / consensus participants.**
- **Outcomes:** honest work grows their standing; Byzantine peers can't cheat
  them; influence is earned, not bought raw; low overhead.
- **Promise:** consensus is deterministic and reputation-gated; standing costs
  sustained, challenged real work (M0), not a stake or a coin; equivocation and
  forgery are detected and cost the actor.

**9. Suppression / takedown / kill-list curators.**
- **Outcomes:** their lists are honored by operators who *choose* to trust them
  (voluntary, pluralistic); real teeth on genuinely harmful content; curation
  is trusted and auditable, with a false entry visible and reputation-costly;
  funded/rewarded for a public-safety service.
- **Promise:** you can publish a takedown list with *effect proportional to who
  trusts you* — never a global switch; accuracy is rewarded, over-reach is
  penalized, and every honored suppression is auditable.
- **Stance:** takedown is **consent-based and plural** — many competing lists,
  operators subscribe to those matching their jurisdiction and values. We build
  the mechanism for *transparent, chosen* suppression, and refuse to build a
  mechanism for *imposed, silent* suppression.

**10. Legal authorities / regulators.**
- **Outcomes:** a real path to remove illegal content within a jurisdiction,
  with accountability.
- **Promise:** jurisdiction-scoped takedown via operators and curators who
  honor it — and *no* lever for global censorship or user surveillance.

### D. Builder personas

**11. Developers / integrators.**
- **Outcomes:** stable, documented APIs/SDKs; the daemon-as-local-service is
  trivial to embed; the link is a clean primitive; predictable, composable
  behavior; deliver utility without running infrastructure.
- **Promise:** silt is a dependency you can reason about — documented seams,
  stable link format, a local API. *(This section is the website's on-ramp.)*

**12. Application / utility operators — the infra↔utility bridge.**
- **Outcomes:** rely on the substrate's guarantees (availability, integrity,
  privacy) to build higher-order products, reasoning clearly about what silt
  promises vs. what they must add.
- **Promise:** the substrate's guarantees are explicit and testable, so you know
  exactly which load you're carrying and which you're inheriting.

### E. Meta / systemic

**13. The commons (the network itself).**
- **Outcomes:** no single point of control/failure; self-healing under churn;
  economics where reward tracks useful work; resistant to Sybil, pollution, and
  DoS.

**14. Adversaries (anti-personas — outcomes we DENY).**
- Censor, surveil, forge, free-ride, Sybil the DHT, equivocate in consensus,
  exhaust resources, poison routing. **Each adversary outcome, inverted, is a
  security tenet.** We measure success by how impossible *or unrewarding* we
  make each.

---

## Part VIII — The value loop (how outcomes interlock)

The economy closes as a chain of served guarantees:

```
operators + relays + registries + caretakers  →  a substrate with guarantees
developers + application operators             →  turn guarantees into utility
publishers + consumers                         →  the demand that funds the loop
validators + curators + authorities            →  keep the loop honest and lawful
```

**The through-line:**
- Every persona's incentive is **satisfied by serving the persona above it** —
  reward flows down the stack from the value consumed at the top.
- **No persona's good may require another's harm.**
- Where outcomes genuinely tension, the tenet is our **explicit stance on the
  tradeoff**, held in the open:

| Tension | Our stance |
|---|---|
| Publisher permanence vs. takedown | Permanence by default; takedown only via *chosen, transparent* lists — never silent or global. |
| Consumer privacy vs. legal accountability | The *refusal to surveil* is absolute (silt builds no who-read-what log); access-*unobservability* is a metadata-layer goal held in tension, bounded by the anonymity trilemma — not a blob-layer absolute (immutable #4, D-PRIV). Accountability acts on *content* (jurisdiction-scoped), never on who read it. |
| Privacy vs. Sybil-resistance (the M0 edge) | Identity is free and private; *standing* costs sustained challenged work; publishing stays unlinkable from standing. We buy Sybil-resistance with *proven work*, never with a coin, a stake, or deanonymization. |
| Operator freedom vs. availability | Operators are free to leave; availability is the network's job (repair), not a shackle on any operator. |
| Decentralization vs. usability | Rendezvous may be centralized *for convenience* but never *load-bearing*; the decentralized path must always exist. |
| Openness vs. abuse resistance | Open to participate, but reward is gated on delivered value and reputation, so abuse doesn't pay. |

## Part IX — The three tiers (immutable / tenet / evolving)

**Immutable — amending is close to redefining the project; requires deliberate,
reviewed consensus.**

- **M0 — the mission:** *hold* the privacy × accountability × Sybil trilemma —
  refuse to trade any corner away; abandoning any corner abandons the project.
  Held **iff** the external V3 red-team suite denies all three failure modes
  (Part 0) — where the Sybil mode is the *systemic* C1 + C2 claim (no discount,
  no quiet capture), not a per-primitive test. Not a victory claim — a refusal,
  bound to a falsifiable test.
- The six corners made structural:
  1. **Content-blind by construction** (B4) — hosts store ciphertext they cannot
     read or choose.
  2. **The bytes are the truth** (S1/B3) — content-addressed, re-verified,
     bit-perfect or an explicit failure; never silently wrong.
  3. **No *permanent* center** (T1/S4) — nothing *permanently* load-bearing; no
     machine or operator can take content down globally. Bootstrap
     centralization is allowed but must be **explicit, time-boxed, and shed on
     measured decentralization**: the launch-window anchor validators are
     training wheels, not a center, and the decentralized path exists from day
     one. What is forbidden is a *standing* dependency on any node — not the
     honest admission that a young network leans on scaffolding while it matures.
     M0's Sybil soundness is *conditional* on this maturation: the composition
     (C1) is sound in the mature regime, the anchors scaffold the young one, and
     the bridge is the **shed metric** — cost-to-corrupt / Nakamoto-coefficient
     over bond-distinct *operators*, sampled Byzantine-robustly. The bet, stated
     plainly: maturity is reached before the scaffolding can be captured. The shed
     is mechanized as a **one-way latch** (`everMature`) that never re-arms, so no
     later concentration can restore a standing dependency on the anchors (F-1);
     de-maturation liveness is a real-bond ≥⅔ super-quorum, and cold sync is pinned
     to a **weak-subjectivity checkpoint** — the honest cost of "no permanent
     center" is a bounded, socially-recoverable re-centralization residual (the
     honest whale), owned in `design/m0.md` §10, not a privileged party.
  4. **Access is unsurveilled — silt refuses to surveil, and pursues
     access-privacy to the trilemma's limit** (Don't #3). silt builds *no*
     mechanism to log or link who-fetched-what, and pushes access-privacy as far
     as proven crypto allows at the **metadata layer** (mixnet transport, private
     lookup, unlinkable retrieval tokens). What is *never* guaranteed is
     blob-layer unobservability against a global adversary — the anonymity
     trilemma is a hard wall (strong anonymity + low bandwidth + low latency: pick
     two), and a participating node sees the keys it routes and serves. So this
     corner is the **refusal to surveil** (absolute) plus **access-unobservability
     held in tension** (metadata-layer, bounded by anonymity-set size) — not an
     absolute blob-layer guarantee.
  5. **No silent or global censorship** (Don't #2) — takedown is transparent,
     consensual, and plural; never one switch. Every honored revocation is
     committed to an append-only **transparency log** (CT-style, with
     inclusion/consistency proofs), so silt can *prove* it never flipped a global
     switch — the goal being a formal **non-globality** guarantee (how much
     survived, on how many independent hosts).
  6. **Core carries zero meaning, forever** (T3) — the Aslan boundary.

**Build-immutables — held at the same amendment bar, but about *how we build*,
not *what silt is*.** The corners above are **product-immutables**: change one
and it is a different project. These are **build-immutables**: change one and
the project silently rots as it grows. They are distinct in kind but equal in
standing — amended only by the same deliberate, reviewed consensus:

  1. **Three-tier Definition of Done** (V1/V2) — no major component is "done"
     until it is proven at unit + integration/sim + e2e; a skipped tier is
     stated with a reason (V4), never silent.
  2. **A bug fixed once stays fixed, caught locally** (V5) — every discovered
     defect ships with a failing-first regression test at its tier(s),
     runnable on a contributor's own machine, so CI is the backstop and never
     the first line of defense.
  3. **One signal, one job — never fuse transport with security.** A single
     measurement must not serve two masters. Reply-latency is *transport* (RTT +
     jitter) **and** *compute* (the security quantity) — gating on the sum is
     unsound; routing reachability is not consensus standing; liveness is not
     correctness. Security rests on **structure** (in the proof object) or
     **statistics** (over many independent measurements), never on a single
     network number the adversary's own path can move — *latency proves
     proximity, never diligence.* A timing signal may ship as a **soft,
     disclosed** deterrent, but a **hard** security gate must be structural, and
     an unbuilt structure is an **owned, named residual** (`design/owned-residuals.md`),
     not a wall-clock stopgap. This law caught two real silt defects from one
     rule: the C1 reply-latency gate (transport fused with compute) and the #288
     evict-on-one-miss (routing reachability fused with consensus standing).
  4. **Cheap honest participation is a security constraint, not a marketing
     feature.** No defense may raise the floor of honest participation. A
     mechanism that prices out the small operator — scaling a min-bond off a
     transport knob, demanding GiB where MiB suffices — is a **regression against
     silt's reason to exist** (Part 0), even if it closes a real attack. Security
     parameters must be **decoupled from performance/transport tuning** so
     hardening one axis never taxes the other.
  5. **Build for the adverse internet — durability is the default, not a
     hardening pass.** silt is network-heavy software whose every path runs on the
     open internet, where **jitter, latency, packet loss, and reordering are the
     everyday case**, not the exception. A network function is not "done" until it
     survives them: **generous, adaptive transport deadlines** (per-peer
     Jacobson/Karels RTO — RFC 6298 — sized to the worst real path, and *scaled to
     payload size*, never a magic constant), **retry — don't evict** a live peer on
     a single slow/dropped packet (Kademlia's least-recently-seen contract),
     **minimum-filter** a noisy latency signal to its floor (NTP clock filter,
     BBR `min_rtt`) rather than trusting one sample, and keep **large payloads off
     the critical path** (succinct proofs > FEC > QUIC). This is the *liveness*
     dual of #3: #3 forbids gating **security** on an optimistic network; this
     forbids gating **liveness** on one. The research on how mature networks
     already solve this is *written down* — **consult `docs/network-durability.md`
     BEFORE inventing any timeout / retry / eviction / large-payload scheme.** silt
     has repeatedly lost days re-deriving what RFC 6298, Kademlia, and the mature
     PoST cohort settled decades ago; both **#286** (a flat transport deadline
     wedged quorum-2 genesis cross-region) and **#288** (a flat deadline +
     evict-on-one-miss starved consensus under loss) were this law unlearned.
  6. **Root-cause before you patch — attribute before you ship.** No knob moves
     before a log, trace, or test **names the mechanism** of the failure. Before
     writing a fix, write the one-paragraph mechanism: *the failure is X **because**
     Y; this change addresses Y **by** Z.* If you cannot write it with evidence, you
     are guessing — **stop, instrument, and reduce to a cheap deterministic repro**
     (the `netem` / `flakynet` / sim harness, on a laptop in minutes); and if the
     mechanism is still unknown, **or the change touches a security parameter, a
     consensus rule, or a published claim, consult research BEFORE building or
     spending a billable run.** **Grep for the mechanism before building new
     machinery** — a surprising amount is *unused-correct* code, not missing code
     (`launchAnchor` already solved the genesis-bootstrap chicken-and-egg, comment
     and all). An expensive/billable run **confirms** an already-understood,
     locally-reproduced fix; it never **discovers** a cause or **tests** a guess.
     This is the *sequencing* dual of #3 and #5: those say *what* is sound; this
     says *root-cause first*, because the recurring cost is patching a symptom one
     layer above its cause. The discipline is written down — **consult
     `docs/build-process.md` BEFORE reaching for a knob.** Drawn from repeated real
     losses: the #286 handshake EOF "fixed" with a fixed-constant timeout (the cause
     was *no outbound addresses*), a billable run spent to *discover* the ~8 MB
     genesis block (deterministic, reproducible in-process), and #288's
     evict-on-one-miss — each a patch one layer above a structural cause.

**Tenets — canon, amendable with reviewed consensus and evidence.** Everything
else in Parts I–VIII, including the strong disciplines we hold nearly as firmly
as the immutables but that describe *how we build and govern* rather than *what
silt is*: trust-but-verify / no-optimistic-operations (B7), best-components-
novel-composition (B8), reward-tracks-value (Don't #7), operator-autonomous-
security-gated-updates (R4), and the per-persona promises and tradeoff stances
(Parts VII–VIII).

**Evolving — expected to change as we learn.** Specific algorithms and
parameters (erasure k/n, replication factor, cache policy, DHT constants), the
*exact* economic mechanism, and which roles ship first — **including the
Sybil-cost parameters that keep C1 + C2 true at the network's current size:** the
non-substitutable-resource weights in `C_honest` (disk × address-diversity ×
time × served demand), the concentration threshold *k*, the demand-attestation
ratio, and the audit/decay windows. These are *held in tension* and re-tuned as
the network grows — **not closed.**

> **The principle-not-mechanism rule, and its one exception.** A tenet gates V1
> as a *principle*, never as a *mechanism* — "reward tracks value" is canon, but
> *which* economic mechanism satisfies it, and *when*, is a roadmap call (see
> `ROADMAP.md`). The **single deliberate exception** is M0: the trilemma
> resolution — token-less, work-backed, unlinkable reputation — is not a
> feature that satisfies a principle, it *is* the reason silt exists, so its
> real (not placeholder) mechanism is pulled into V1 by definition. Decided
> 2026-07-31 (trust plane is a V1 pillar) and sharpened 2026-08-02 (hold the
> real-crypto bar; build the car from best-in-class components, prove it
> multi-machine). Publisher privacy (F1) ships as **blind-signed publish
> tokens** (Chaumian) that unlink a publish from the durable reputation key.

## Amendment log

- **2026-08-01** — Ratified as canon (#54). Reviewer questions resolved:
  persona #1 is "Aslan users" (name kept); application-operator (#12) is a
  distinct seat from developer (#11); trust plane is a V1 pillar (Open Q#3
  closed).
- **2026-08-02** — Added **M0** (mission-immutable, the trilemma) as Part 0 and
  the supreme immutable; restructured Part IX into three tiers (immutable /
  tenet / evolving) with six mechanism-immutables; **moved B7, Don't #7, and R4
  out of the immutable set into the tenet tier** (they are disciplines/stances,
  not project identity); added **B8** (best components, novel composition);
  stated the load-bearing novel claim and the principle-not-mechanism exception
  explicitly.
- **2026-08-02 (intention review)** — Acted on the fresh-eyes *intent* review
  (`docs/reviews/fresh-eyes-2026-08-02-intention.md`). **Requalified M0** from
  "resolve the trilemma" to "*hold* it — refuse to trade any corner away," named
  which corner bootstraps (Sybil-resistance is weakest early and co-matures;
  privacy and accountability hold from day one), and **bound M0 to a falsifiable
  test** (held iff the external V3 red-team suite denies all three failure
  modes). **Reconciled "no center" with the training wheels**: immutable #3 and
  T1 now say "no *permanent* center — bootstrap scaffolding is explicit,
  time-boxed, and sheds on measured decentralization." **Added S7 — durability
  must pay for itself** (the repair loop funded in equilibrium, not charity; the
  Freenet/GNUnet wound). **Named the external adversary** in B8 and V3: the suite
  that certifies a novel composition (and M0) must be written by an outside party
  (audit / bounty / independent red-team), not self-graded.
- **2026-08-02 (build-immutables)** — Added **V5 — a bug fixed once stays fixed,
  and breaks are caught locally**: every discovered defect ships in the same
  change as a failing-first regression test at its tier(s), runnable on a
  contributor's own machine, so CI is the backstop and never the first line.
  Introduced the **build-immutable** category in Part IX — distinct in kind from
  the product-immutables (which define *what silt is*) but equal in standing
  (how we build) — and placed the three-tier Definition of Done (V1/V2) and V5
  there. Prompted by finding the integrated hole-punch gap (#27 Phase 3) *locally*
  via the Docker NAT harness, not at CI: the discipline that made that possible is
  now canon (Andrew).
- **2026-08-05 (composition thesis)** — Reframed M0's Sybil corner as a *systemic*
  claim held by **composition**, not a Sybil-proof primitive (per
  `docs/design/m0.md`, from the research capstone `09-m0-as-composition.md`).
  Defined the Sybil failure mode as **C1 (no discount)** + **C2 (no quiet
  capture)** and made it the V3 target; clarified in **B8** that the red-team
  certifies the *composition*, so a primitive failing a standalone Sybil-proof
  test is Douceur, not an M0 failure. **Fused S7 with the Sybil corner** —
  durability budget = Sybil budget = one ledger. Made immutable #3's young→mature
  maturation an explicit *bet* bridged by the shed metric (cost-to-corrupt /
  Nakamoto-over-operators). Named Sybil-resistance as *re-pricing +
  concentration-bounding*, not prevention, with the honest-whale residual
  *bounded* (not eliminated) by C2, and moved its parameters to the evolving tier.
  This is the reset that changes what "done" means for the Sybil corner: from an
  impossibility (a Sybil-proof primitive) to a reachable target (C1 + C2 at
  stated parameters).
- **2026-08-05 (deferred decisions)** — Recorded owner decisions derived from the
  accepted research package (see [decisions.md](decisions.md)). **D-PRIV:** amended
  immutable #4 from an absolute ("never observable") to *refuse-to-surveil*
  (absolute) + *access-unobservability held in tension* at the metadata layer (the
  anonymity trilemma is a hard wall; blob-layer unobservability is not
  guaranteed); Don't #3 and the Part 0 / persona echoes harmonized. **D-S7:**
  relaxed "no token" to "no *speculative external* token" and stated the durability
  funding model in S7 (internal escrowable credit reserve + auto-skim + rarest-shard
  bounty; standing stays coin-free); center-less proof-of-repair routed to research
  as the open construction. **D-TAKEDOWN:** immutable #5 now commits every honored
  revocation to a CT-style transparency log toward a formal non-globality
  guarantee. **D-DISCLOSURE:** added Don't #8 (no decryption backdoor at core).
  D-CRYPTO-AGILITY (post-V1) and D-ANCHORS (launch-config) are recorded in
  decisions.md only.
- **2026-08-06 (commission answers folded in)** — The follow-up research commission
  (`research-outcome/commission/`) answered the routed-to-research constructions.
  **D-S7:** center-less proof-of-repair **now exists** as a composition of proven
  parts (transparent polynomial-commitment correctness + Shacham–Waters
  retrievability + DAS quorum, no new primitive for plain-RS); S7 rewritten to say
  so, and durability restated as **finite-but-renewable, not "perpetual"** —
  perpetual solvency needs a positive credit-denominated cost decline `g` the 2020s
  no longer guarantee, so silt funds a renewable horizon and instruments `g`.
  **D-TAKEDOWN:** the formal non-globality metric now has a construction (survivor
  Nakamoto-coefficient + ZK threshold predicate revealing only `t`). **D-DEMAND
  (new):** standing is priced on **cost-to-wash, never receipt count** — the blind
  demand receipt gives unforgeable-delivery + fetcher-unlinkability but *not* demand
  authenticity (a Douceur limit); wash is re-priced, not proven away. The **core
  open problem** is now named precisely: the **shared-content sealing boundary**
  (plain PoR over shared shards leaks γ→1/N; silt is not exposed today because
  standing uses a dedicated identity-keyed bond plot, not the shared shards). Full
  detail in [decisions.md](decisions.md) and [design/m0.md](design/m0.md) §10.
- **2026-08-06 (external-audit honesty propagation)** — Two independent audits of the docs
  pass (a research *comprehension* audit + a red-team *intention* audit) found comprehension
  excellent but a **propagation gap**: the held-in-tension honesty that was correct in
  `m0.md §10` / issue #182 had not reached the tenet layer, the risk surface, or the public
  site, so three things read as *achieved* that are deliberately *open*. Fixed at canon: **S7
  reworded** — the "one ledger" (served-content ⇄ standing fusion) is the *design goal*, **not
  shipped**; today standing comes only from the dedicated bond plot, separate from served
  content, and fusing them is gated on the γ→1/N problem (#182). **Part 0 C_honest** marked
  *target composition (D×A×T×B) vs. shipped subset (≈ D only)* — B (served demand) unbuilt
  (#181), A (address diversity) at the DHT layer not yet in the standing number — so C1 is a
  *conditional* claim. **Part VIII value-loop table** row corrected from "Privacy of *access*
  is absolute" (the exact absolute D-PRIV retired) to the refusal-to-surveil-absolute /
  access-held-in-tension form. **Proof-of-repair** softened from "now exists" to *construction
  designed, not yet built (H7)*. Companion risk-register / threat-catalog / public-site fixes
  landed the same honesty (γ→1/N as an open-risk row; `g≤0`; CPR-adversarial-placement; the
  public Sybil-standing copy corrected to bond-backed). *(Update 2026-08-08: H7 is now BUILT and
  adversarially verified — see the tenet text above; the blind-commitment leg deferred as a
  fast-follow.)* Comprehension was faithful; this was a
  propagation fix, not a re-think.
- **2026-08-10** — Added **build-immutables #3 (one signal, one job — never fuse
  transport with security)** and **#4 (cheap honest participation is a security
  constraint)**, distilled from the external network-durability-vs-space-time
  research opinion (`silt-reviews/research/…network-durability-vs-spacetime…`,
  2026-08-10) that field-testing under adverse networks (`integration/flakynet`,
  #288/#289) provoked. #3 generalizes the two defects that motivated the consult —
  the C1 reply-latency gate (transport fused with the compute security signal) and
  the #288 evict-on-one-miss (routing reachability fused with consensus standing) —
  into one bright line: security lives in the proof or in statistics-over-many,
  never in a single network measurement; a timing signal is a soft disclosed
  deterrent, never a hard gate (the hard version is structural / owned-residual).
  #4 promotes silt's "cheap to run" mission (Part 0) into a veto over security
  designs: no fix may raise the floor of honest participation. Both enforced in
  code by the same-week decouple-anti-release-from-transport + soft-C1-gate work.
- **2026-08-11** — Added **build-immutable #5 (build for the adverse internet —
  durability is the default)** and its companion reference **`docs/network-durability.md`**,
  distilled from the same network-durability research opinion. Where #3/#4 are the
  *security* duals (never gate security on the network; never tax participation),
  #5 is the *liveness* discipline: every networking path must survive jitter,
  latency, loss, and reordering by default, using the settled best practices
  (adaptive per-peer RTO / size-scaled deadlines, retry-not-evict, minimum-filter,
  succinct-payload > FEC > QUIC) rather than a re-invented magic constant.
  Provoked by **#286** — the first full multi-region GCP field test found a fresh
  quorum-2 objective chain wedged at genesis because a flat transport deadline
  couldn't carry the one-time ~1.5 MB bond-registration block across the WAN; the
  fix (a size-aware transport deadline) is exactly the "generous, payload-scaled
  transport deadline" the research prescribes. The doc exists so future builders
  read the settled answer instead of losing days re-deriving it (as #286/#288 did).
- **2026-08-12** — Added **build-immutable #6 (root-cause before you patch —
  attribute before you ship)** and its companion reference **`docs/build-process.md`**,
  distilled from the research team's `build-process-root-cause-first-ADVICE.md`
  (2026-08-12). Where #3/#4/#5 govern *what* is sound, #6 governs the *sequencing*
  of a fix: instrument and name the failure mechanism (a one-paragraph *X because Y;
  fix Y by Z*) before touching a knob; reduce to a cheap local repro before an
  expensive run; grep for existing machinery before building new; and consult
  research when the mechanism is unknown or the change touches security / consensus /
  a claim — not after two guesses. Provoked by the repeated **#286** WAN loop: a
  handshake-EOF "fixed" with a fixed-constant timeout (real cause: no outbound
  addresses), and a billable multi-region run spent to *discover* the ~8 MB genesis
  block that was deterministic and reproducible in-process. The correct genesis fix
  (spread bond regs; commit small via the already-existing `launchAnchor` anchor
  bootstrap) was *unused-correct code* — the rule-6 poster child. Same corrective as
  the comprehension/owned-residuals audits (docs ahead of code there, fixes ahead of
  root-cause here): **verify/attribute before you ship.**
