# Convergent Encryption: deduplication vs. secrecy

## The tension

A content-addressed store deduplicates for free: identical bytes hash to
the same ID, so the network stores them once no matter how many people
add them. Encryption normally destroys this: good encryption is
*randomized*, so your encryption of `ubuntu-24.04.iso` and mine share not
a single byte, and the network stores every copy separately.

Convergent encryption is the classic trick for having (most of) both.

## The trick

Derive the key *from the plaintext itself*:

```
secret = SHA-256(plaintext chunk)          ← anyone with the chunk gets the same secret
key    = HKDF(secret, "key")
nonce  = HKDF(secret, "nonce")
ct     = AES-256-GCM(key, nonce, plaintext)
```

Same plaintext ⇒ same key ⇒ same ciphertext ⇒ same chunk ID ⇒ dedup
works across *everyone*, even though the stored bytes are encrypted and
useless to anyone who doesn't already know the plaintext... or the
secret, which silt records in the file's manifest. Holding a manifest
= able to decrypt; holding only chunks = holding noise.

## Wait — a fixed nonce with GCM?

Reusing a (key, nonce) pair for two different messages is catastrophic in
GCM (it leaks the XOR of plaintexts and can leak the authentication key).
Here it's safe *by construction*: the key is a function of the exact
plaintext, so the only way to reuse the pair is to encrypt the same
message again — which produces the same ciphertext, revealing nothing
new. Determinism isn't a bug here; it is the entire feature.

## The confirmation attack (why this isn't for secrets)

Deterministic encryption has an unavoidable leak: **anyone can test a
guess.** An attacker who suspects you stored a specific document runs the
same public recipe on their guess and checks whether the resulting chunk
ID exists in the network. Chunk present ⇒ guess confirmed.

The damage scales with guessability:

- *Public data* (OS images, media, datasets): nothing to confirm that
  isn't already public. Convergent is ideal here — which is exactly why
  it's offered as an **opt-in** mode. (As of H6, 2026-08-05, the default
  for `silt add` is *private* random-key encryption, not convergent — you
  opt in to convergent to buy cross-user dedup, accepting its
  confirmation surface.)
- *Low-entropy private data* (a form letter with your salary in one
  blank): an attacker can enumerate every plausible fill-in and confirm
  which one you stored. A few thousand SHA-256 calls; disastrous.
- *High-entropy secrets*: unguessable, so unconfirmable — but if your
  data is unguessable anyway, you lose nothing by using `private` mode.

Rule of thumb: convergent encryption protects data exactly as well as
that data is *unguessable*. For anything personal, `silt add -mode private`
uses a random per-file key with index-bound nonces and no dedup. That
defeats the **chunk-ID** confirmation attack described above — an attacker
who runs the recipe on a guess gets a chunk ID that is not in the network.

**It does not make the object unobservable, and this section previously
said it did.** Private mode removes the guess-and-confirm oracle. It does
not remove the **length** fingerprint: the exact plaintext byte count is
published on-chain in `ports.Entry.FileSize` for private-mode objects
exactly as for convergent ones, so the worked example above — a form letter
with one blank — remains partitioned by exact byte length, and an attacker
who can enumerate the fill-ins can still narrow by length without ever
touching a chunk (threat-catalog F3(a)). It also did not, until 2026-09-11,
remove the **mode** label: any peer could recover the mode from the manifest
chunk's frame length. That one is closed — `manifest.secretsPlainLen` pads
the sealed secrets to a length derived from the public shard count — but
`-mode private` was for a time itself a public statement about a root
(threat-catalog F8).

The honest scope: `-mode private` defeats confirmation-of-content. It does
not deliver unobservability, and silt does not claim it anywhere.

Real-world note: this attack is not hypothetical — it's why Dropbox-era
"cross-user deduplication" designs were abandoned, and the literature
(Douceur et al. 2002, who named convergent encryption; the "DupLESS"
line of work) revolves around blunting exactly this leak.

Code: `core/crypto/crypto.go`. Tests prove determinism (dedup),
tamper-rejection, and that private mode binds each chunk to its index so
ciphertexts can't be reordered.
