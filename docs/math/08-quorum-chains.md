# Quorum Chains: agreement without mining

## What a blockchain actually is

Strip away the coins and the hype and a blockchain is one data
structure plus one social rule:

- **The structure**: each block contains the hash of the previous
  block. That's it. The consequence is enormous: tampering with any
  historical block changes its hash, which breaks the next block's
  `Prev`, which changes ITS hash, and so on to the tip. History is a
  chain of commitments; you cannot edit the middle without forging
  everything after it. (This is the Merkle idea from note 01, bent
  from a tree into a line through time.)
- **The rule**: who gets to append? Everything interesting about a
  blockchain lives in this one question.

## Why Silt doesn't mine

Bitcoin's answer is proof-of-work: appending costs electricity, and
history is whichever chain burned the most of it. That is a marvel of
adversarial engineering — and wildly wrong for a storage registry. PoW
buys permissionless global consensus at the price of enormous waste and
probabilistic finality; Silt's registry needs cheap, immediate
finality among parties who already maintain measurable relationships.

Because Silt nodes already EARN measurable reputations — passed
storage audits (note 05), attached to unforgeable key-hashed
identities — the network has something Bitcoin's anonymous miners never
had: a native notion of standing. Crucially, that standing now **costs
challenged, held storage**: a validator seals an identity-bound storage
bond, and validators challenge each other's bonds over the wire,
verifying against only the committed Merkle root. Serving alone no
longer buys standing (two colluding nodes could wash-mint served-bytes
for free); standing is bond-gated, must be *sustained* (it decays if a
bond stops being re-proven). No single primitive here is Sybil-proof:
M0's Sybil-resistance is a **systemic composition** — C1 (no discount: a
fraction *q* of standing costs ≈ *q*·C_honest) + C2 (no quiet capture) —
held in tension, where C_honest = disk × address-diversity × time ×
served-demand. So N standings cost N× of every non-substitutable resource
(disk × address-diversity × time × served-demand), not just N distinct
bonds on N disks. So the rule is reputation-weighted quorum:

```
a block commits iff:
  reputation(proposer) ≥ MinProposerRep
  and ≥ Quorum DISTINCT attesters, each with reputation ≥ MinAttesterRep,
      none of them the proposer, signed the block hash
```

An attestation is an Ed25519 signature over the block hash, and the
hash covers height, ancestry, entries, and proposer — so a signature
endorses the block's exact content AND its exact place in history.
Forge any byte and every signature dies at once (the tamper test in
`chain_test.go` is one line for this reason).

## Why the quorum math holds up

- **No cheap standing (composition, not a lone primitive).** Reputation
  attaches to NodeID = SHA-256(pubkey). The per-primitive claim "you
  can't manufacture standing" is retired — by Douceur, no single
  primitive is Sybil-proof, and one failing a standalone Sybil-proof test
  is expected, not an M0 failure. What holds instead is the **systemic
  composition** — C1 (no discount: a fraction *q* of standing costs
  ≈ *q*·C_honest) + C2 (no quiet capture) — held in tension: N standings
  cost N× of every non-substitutable resource (C_honest = disk ×
  address-diversity × time × served-demand). The bond (one axis — D — of
  that composition) is where this note's mechanism bites: each identity
  must seal and sustain a challenged storage bond before its signature
  counts. The rate limit on writing history is the rate at which
  strangers can earn trust — exactly Andrew's rule that "no single node
  agrees until reputation is highly established."
- **Validators don't trust each other's arithmetic.** Every replica
  re-validates everything: latecomers syncing the chain re-check every
  signature, reputation, and quorum themselves. A lying peer can waste
  your bandwidth but cannot feed you an invalid history.
- **Each validator judges by its OWN ledger.** Reputation isn't a
  global number anyone asserts; it's what each validator has locally
  observed (audits it ran, serving it saw). Lying to one validator
  buys nothing with the others — a proposal needs a quorum of
  independently-convinced judges.

## The honest fine print

This is a quorum chain for a network with an honest validator
majority — not Byzantine fork-choice consensus. v1 has no
reorganizations: the first valid block at a height wins, and
simultaneous proposals race (one gets `ErrWrongParent` and retries on
the new head). (This describes the base/legacy chain: the objective
fork-choice path since H4 now sizes quorums to a Byzantine supermajority
(n−f). **Corrected 2026-09-12:** the hardened path does NOT reconcile
competing forks to whichever carries more bond standing — ranking is
height then head hash with no bond term, and the finality gate admits only forks
containing the committed head. So the "no reorg" caveat does not invert
on the hardened path; it holds there for a STRONGER reason. A sub-quorum
partition commits nothing at all, stalls, and catches up to the
majority's history on heal. What the legacy path lacks is the quorum
sizing, not a reorg it would otherwise perform.) A colluding quorum of high-reputation validators could
write bad entries — the design bets that entities who spent months
earning bond-backed reputations have more to lose than to gain, the
same wager proof-of-stake makes with capital. What the chain buys over
a hosted registry is concrete: no single owner, replicated history,
tamper-evidence, and gatekeeping by earned standing rather than by
whoever runs the server.

One more piece of honest fine print: the bond that backs standing is
**one axis (D — distinct sealed disk per identity) of M0's systemic
composition**, not "the Sybil corner." The earlier RAM-held,
proof-of-space-*lite* placeholder is stale: post-G2/H2, the
disk-persisted, byte-bound depth-robust-graph plot **shipped** (see
[`../design/m0-sybil-rebind.md`](../design/m0-sybil-rebind.md) for the
bond as-built). The outcome — standing costs sustained, challenged,
identity-bound storage on a real disk — is in place today.

Code: `core/chain` (blocks, rules), `core/node/chainrole.go` (propose /
attest / commit / sync), `credit.Reputation` (the standing formula),
`core/bond` (the challenged storage bond that gates standing).
Run `silt sim run consensus` for the deterministic version, or three
`silt daemon -validator` processes for the real one.
