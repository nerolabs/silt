# Build log

The story and *reasoning* of building Silt — the design forks, the dead
ends, the decisions and why they went the way they did. This is
deliberately distinct from its two neighbors:

- **[CHANGELOG](../../CHANGELOG.md)** records *what shipped*, release by
  release.
- **[ROADMAP](../../ROADMAP.md)** records *what's next*.
- The build log records *how it was built and why* — the narrative a
  future reader (or employer, or contributor) can inspect to understand
  the thinking, not just the result.

It is strictly about building the **infrastructure**. The resolver layer
("Aslan") is a separate product with its own story; nothing about it
belongs here (see [docs/aslan-boundary.md](../aslan-boundary.md)).

## Format

One Markdown file per entry, named `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`. The first line
is an `# H1` title; everything after it is the entry body (standard
Markdown — `##`/`###` subheads, `-` lists, `**bold**`, `` `code` ``,
and `[links](https://…)`).

`scripts/gen_buildlog.py` renders every dated entry, newest first, into
`website/buildlog.html`, styled to match the site — the same
source-of-truth pipeline as the changelog and roadmap. The page is
gitignored and produced at deploy time, so it cannot fall out of sync with
these files: there is no committed copy to drift
(`D-WEBSITE-HTML-AT-DEPLOY-2026-09-12`).

To add an entry: drop a new dated file in this directory and commit it. Run
`python3 scripts/gen_buildlog.py` if you want to preview the page; do not
commit its output.

## Archived, not an entry

The original project-inception brief (`genesis-handoff.md`) has been moved to
[`/archive/process/genesis-handoff.md`](../../archive/process/genesis-handoff.md)
as frozen history — it is preserved for provenance (several code comments cite
"the HANDOFF"), and its banner flags the fragments that now contradict canon. It
was never a dated entry, so it was never rendered to the site.
