# One automated repair-under-churn integration test: stand up a real swarm
# (registry seed + a pool of holder daemons + a caretaker), publish an
# erasure-coded file, then KILL holders in waves until enough erasure columns
# are stranded that the caretaker must reconstruct the lost shards from parity
# and re-scatter them to fresh survivors — asserting the file stays bit-perfect
# through it all. This is the real-daemon analog of `silt sim run churn`.
#
# Why it is patient by design: repair is not instant. A caretaker sweeps every
# RepairInterval (60s, compiled in — not a flag), reconstructs from k=10 of a
# stripe's n=16 shards, and re-seeds. Content is also 3x-replicated, so a stripe
# only needs rebuilding once node deaths drop *every* replica of more than
# RepairSlack(=2) of its columns. So we kill progressively — one holder at a
# time, waiting a full sweep window after each — until the caretaker is forced
# to actually repair, then prove retrieval survived. A field test should run
# close to real time; we do not rush the sweeps.
#
# Usage:  ./run.sh              # build, churn, assert, tear down; exit 0 = PASS
#         KEEP=1 ./run.sh       # leave the swarm up afterward to poke at
#         HOLDERS=20 WAVES=3 FILE_BYTES=50000000 ./run.sh   # crank it up

# makes this a DETERMINISTIC LAPTOP gate: with one copy per column, killing a
# holder immediately strands its columns, so a few heaviest-first kills push a
# stripe past RepairSlack and FORCE a reconstruct — repair is exercised in
# seconds on a small swarm, isolating the erasure-repair mechanic (reconstruct
# from k=10 parity + re-scatter) from replication redundancy.
#   The FAITHFUL, shipped default is 3x-replication (a stripe only needs repair
#   once ALL copies of >RepairSlack columns die). Reproducing THAT needs a large
#   swarm where placement is spread — set REPLICATION=3 HOLDERS>=50 and run it on
#   the GCP field-test harness (integration/cloudtest), not a laptop, where 16
#   holders leave every stripe a live replica after any few kills (coverage stays
#   correctly fine and no repair is forced — the small-swarm coverage cliff).
