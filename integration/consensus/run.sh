# Field test #1 — multi-validator consensus + partition-heal, in real Docker.
#
# The M0 keystone under test: OBJECTIVE on-chain-bond fork-choice. Four real
# `silt daemon -validator` processes on a flat Docker network form two groups.
# A network partition (the built-in test-harness -block-peers flag) severs them;
# each group commits its OWN fork over real TCP. We assert:
#
#   (P0 negative control) an UNBONDED / no-earned-standing publish is REFUSED
#                         (no commit) — the write path is earned, not a stamp.
#   (P1 convergence)      before the partition, group 1's two validators agree
#                         on the same chain head (identical `silt chain-status`).
#   (P2 partition)        the partition is in effect (⚠ PARTITION log on C,D) and
#                         the two groups commit DIFFERENT heads — heavier group 1
#                         = [g,a1,a2] (height 2), lighter group 2 = [g,c1]
#                         (height 1). They do NOT converge onto a shared head
#                         while severed (no cross-group reorg).
#   (P3 heal→converge)   restart C WITHOUT -block-peers, bootstrapped to A. It
#                         reloads its persisted [g,c1], discovers group 1's
#                         heavier fork, and REORGS onto it (real log line), then
#                         its `chain-status` head EQUALS group 1's. The set has
#                         converged to the heavier-bonded chain.
#
# Every assertion keys off a REAL observed CLI flag / stdout line / chain-status
# field — no invented strings. This is the Docker-real counterpart of
# e2e/partition_test.go (in-process), over real sockets and kernel networking.
