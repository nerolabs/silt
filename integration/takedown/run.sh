# Field test #6 — takedown, in real Docker containers.
#
# Proves the safety model behind `silt sim run takedown` + core/denylist over
# the real wire: a takedown is PER-OPERATOR, EXISTENCE-CHECKED, and REVERSIBLE.
#
#   1. Two independent operators (opA, opB) each publish the SAME convergent
#      file → the SAME root. Both serve it (baseline). A control file is
#      published too, to distinguish a real PASS from a global wipe.
#   2. opA loads an operator-local `-denylist` naming that root → it PURGES the
#      held chunks and REFUSES to serve it, while opB (never denies) still
#      serves the identical root, and the control file survives everywhere.
#      Per-operator, per-hash — no global switch.
#   3. Existence check (on-chain): a trusted validator revokes the REAL,
#      committed root → a takedown block commits; revoking a BOGUS root → no
#      block ever commits (the chain refuses to revoke what it never published).
#   4. Reversal: restart opA WITHOUT the denylist and re-publish the same
#      convergent file → opA serves the once-denied root again. The denial was
#      conditional on the list, not a permanent ban.
#
# Usage:  ./run.sh          # build, test, tear down; exit 0 = PASS
#         KEEP=1 ./run.sh   # leave the topology up afterward to poke at
