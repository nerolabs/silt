# Shared entrypoint for every daemon in the client/UI harness (seed, holders,
# caretaker). On a flat Docker network a wildcard bind is not self-advertising
# ("a wildcard bind is never advertised on its own" — daemon -advertise help),
# so each daemon must announce the concrete, routable IP its container got from
# Docker's IPAM. We discover it from /etc/hosts via getent (glibc, always
# present — no iproute2/hostname package needed) and append -advertise, then
# exec the daemon. The compose `command:` supplies everything else.
