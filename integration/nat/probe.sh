# Empirical NAT hole-punch check, behind the harness's real kernel NAT. Runs a
# standalone probe (integration/nat/probe): a coordinator on the public relay
# pairs two peers on separate NATed LANs, swaps the source addresses it
# observed (their NAT mappings), and both peers simultaneously dial each other
# from a reused local port. Success ("DIRECT-OK") means the harness's NAT is
# punchable; with NAT_MODE=symmetric it should fail, which is what forces the
# relay fallback. This validates the #27 approach against real conntrack before
# it's wired into the transport.
#
# ./probe.sh # cone NAT (default) — expect DIRECT-OK
#  NAT_MODE=symmetric ./probe.sh # expect DIRECT-FAIL (relay fallback needed)
