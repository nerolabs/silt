# End-to-end proof that two NATed *daemons* upgrade a relay path to a DIRECT
# connection (#27). nodeA holds a file; nodeB is a caretaker of it, so its
# repair loop probes/fetches the shards from nodeA through the relay — real
# daemon-to-daemon traffic — which triggers the relay-coordinated hole-punch.
# On cone NAT the punch lands and BOTH daemons log a direct connection; on
# symmetric NAT it can't and they stay on the relay.
#
#   ./holepunch.sh                   # cone — expect the punch to land
#   NAT_MODE=symmetric ./holepunch.sh  # expect NO punch (relay stays)
