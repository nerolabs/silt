# NAT's punch behaviour shows through (a home router that permits hole-punching
# is doing the equivalent). None of this weakens the NAT itself — inbound with
# no matching mapping is still dropped.

#  cone (default): preserve/reuse the source port → the same internal (ip,port)
#  maps to a stable external port across destinations (endpoint-independent),
#  so a peer can reuse the mapping the relay observed → PUNCHABLE.
#  symmetric: --random-fully picks a fresh external port per connection, so the
#  mapping is per-destination → the observed endpoint is useless for a punch
#  → the peers must FALL BACK to the relay.

# mapping yet) must be silently dropped and RETRANSMITTED, so that by the retry
# the peer's own outbound SYN has created the reverse mapping and the SYN is
# DNAT'd through. A stock container RSTs the closed port ("connection refused")
# and kills the punch. An already-mapped SYN is DNAT'd in PREROUTING before it
# reaches here, so this only silences the truly-unsolicited ones.
