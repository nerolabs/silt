"""Truth-in-labelling check (research remediation, process suggestion).

M0's whole credibility rests on honest held-vs-closed accounting. The failure mode
the red team keeps finding is *docs-ahead-of-code*: a spec that asserts "closed /
shipped / one-way / covered" for something the code doesn't deliver. This is the
lightweight standing guard against that, run in CI at every build:

  1. STRICT — every test named in docs/design/claims-ledger.md must EXIST. A claim in
     the ledger points at the test/code path that delivers it; if that test is gone
     (renamed, deleted), the claim is now unbacked and the build fails. (Whether the
     test PASSES is the job of the normal test suite; this checks the LINKAGE.)

  2. ADVISORY — scan the canon (TENETS.md, design/m0.md) for strong "delivered" claim
     phrases and report any whose subject is not represented in the ledger, as a nudge
     to either add a claim+test or soften the language. Never fails the build.

Dependency-free (stdlib only). Run: python3 scripts/check_claims.py [--strict]
