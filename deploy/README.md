# Development / test infrastructure — NOT operated by the Silt project

Everything in this directory is **throwaway dev scaffolding**: a way to
stand up one publicly reachable node to develop and test cross-network
reachability (#27) against, because localhost has no NAT to traverse.

Read this before using it, because the distinction matters:

- **Not privileged.** Nothing in the protocol treats this node
  specially. It is an ordinary `silt daemon` that happens to have a
  public IP and the `-relay` flag on.
- **Not default.** No address from here is baked into the binary.
  Peers use it only if an operator passes it to `-bootstrap`,
  `-dns-seed`, or `-relay-via` by hand.
- **Not "official."** SiltHQ publishes source; it does not run the
  network. A developer running a box to test against is an operator
  like any other, and this one is explicitly temporary.
- **Replaced by community peers.** The goal state is many operators
  running reachable `-relay` daemons and publishing `-dns-seed`
  domains; this box is torn down or becomes one unremarkable peer
  among them.

The reasoning is the no-permanent-center immutable: nothing the project runs may
become load-bearing.

## What's here

- `dev-relay.sh` — provision + run script for a small VPS (any
  $5 Debian/Ubuntu box with a public IP). Builds Silt from source and
  runs a daemon with the relay capability on.
- `silt-dev-relay.service` — optional systemd unit so the daemon
  survives reboots for the life of the experiment.

## Quick start (on the VPS)

```sh
# as a normal user with go >= 1.22 installed
git clone https://github.com/nerolabs/silt.git
cd silt/deploy
./dev-relay.sh
```

The script prints the two lines that matter, e.g.:

```
bootstrap: <ID>@203.0.113.7:4001     # for -bootstrap / a dns-seed TXT record
relay-via: <ID>@203.0.113.7:4002     # for NATed daemons' -relay-via
```

Open TCP 4001 (swarm) and 4002 (relay) in the provider's firewall.

Then follow [docs/cross-network-runbook.md](../docs/cross-network-runbook.md)
to prove two NATed machines on different networks can publish and fetch
through it.

## Teardown

Delete the VPS. Nothing in the network depends on it: peers that
learned its address will simply time it out of their routing tables,
and any daemon that used it as `-relay-via` falls back to being
unreachable across networks until pointed at another relay — which is
exactly the dependency honesty the design wants.
