// cmdChainStatus prints a read-only summary of a validator's committed chain
// replica — head height, head hash, and block/entry counts — WITHOUT launching a
// daemon or mutating anything. It reads the same `chain.cbor` the daemon
// persists. This is how an operator confirms the two things flows 5–7 are about
// without hashing files by hand (acceptance new-F2):
//   - CONVERGENCE: run it on each replica; identical head height AND head hash
//     means they agree byte-for-byte on the committed history.
//   - RESTART CATCH-UP: the head height advances after a restarted validator
//     rejoins, instead of staying stuck at its pre-restart height.
