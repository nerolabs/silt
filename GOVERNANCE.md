# Governance

Silt is infrastructure owned by none and run by its participants. This
document states the stance that shapes the architecture.

Silt is **use-agnostic**: it takes zero position on what the network is
used for. It is neutral, content-blind storage — the code cannot know or
attach meaning to what it carries. Any application built *on top* of Silt
(named "Aslan" — a resolver that maps human meaning to opaque roots) is a
separate product in a separate codebase; Silt ships none of it. The boundary is
immutable #6 in [docs/TENETS.md](docs/TENETS.md): core resolves hashes, never names.

## The project publishes software. It does not run the network.

The organization behind Silt writes and publishes source code and
occasionally cuts released binaries. That is all it does. It:

- **runs no nodes** and operates no part of the network,
- **maintains no denylist** and holds no takedown authority,
- ships **no built-in list, no phone-home, no override, no backdoor**,
- receives, at most, a DMCA-designated agent for the *project's own*
  touchpoints (the website and the release artifacts) — not for the
  network, which it does not operate.

This is deliberate and load-bearing. A pure software publisher stands on
the strongest legal footing — publishing code is expression — and there
is no central service to seize, subpoena, or coerce. Whoever runs the
network runs the policy.

## Policy is distributed and earned

Everything that governs the network is decided by its participants
through the same mechanism, and it is all in the code, operated by no one
in particular:

- **Publishing** a file's identifier to the registry requires a quorum
  of validators whose reputation is *earned* (passed storage audits,
  bytes served) — not bought, not granted.
- **Takedown** of a published identifier uses the *same* quorum: an
  append-only revocation record that every replica applies and no single
  node can force. Removing content is exactly as governed as adding it,
  and just as auditable.
- **Operators additionally choose** which local denylists to honor —
  their jurisdiction's, a trusted third party's — the way every network
  operator chooses which blocklists to run. The project supplies none of
  these lists.

## Updates are operator-autonomous and security-gated

The software **never silently auto-updates**. An operator chooses if
and when to upgrade; the project pushes nothing to a running node. The one
concession is *security-gated*: a release that fixes a security-critical
flaw is labeled as such so operators can prioritize it — but the decision,
and the act, remain the operator's. There is no override, no phone-home,
no channel by which the project reaches a node it does not run.

## Contributing

Anyone may contribute. Nothing reaches `main` or a release without a
pull request, green CI, and review — the branch is protected to enforce
it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the flow.
